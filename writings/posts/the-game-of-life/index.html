<p>Life is full of surprises, isn't it?</p>

<p>We can't state what could possibly happen in the future based on the
present events. It's like a pattern but except you don't know what it
would turn to be in the end.</p>

<p>This is what the Cambridge Mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway">John H.
Conway</a> must have
thought about when he invented the <strong>Game of Life</strong>, who was really
interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">Cellular
Automaton</a>, a field of
mathematical research, that is often used in the earlier days to
simulate systems in real world scenario.</p>

<p>His work was influenced by Hungarian-American Mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann">John von
Neumann</a>, who aimed to
build a machine that had the ability to self-replicate itself and thus,
Conway became successful when he was able to simplify Neumann's ideas
using a mathematical model that he had discovered.</p>

<p>I'd like to share a quote that I found really inspiring:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"You know, people think mathematics is complicated. Mathematics is the
  simple bit. Its the stuff we can understand. Its cats that are
  complicated. I mean, what is it in those little molecules and stuff
  that make one cat behave differently than another, or that make a cat?
  And how do you define a cat? I have no idea." - John H. Conway</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What is Game of Life?</h2>

<p>It's a zero-player game on a two-dimensional grid of squares that has no
winners or losers except a certain set of simple mathematical rules that
achieves an unpredictable behavior of whether a pattern (or population)
will die, become stable or grow out of control.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Wikipedia</a> article, these are the following rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused
by underpopulation.</li>
<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next
generation.</li>
<li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by
overpopulation.</li>
<li>Any dead cell with exactly three neighbours becomes a live cell, as
if by reproduction.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is one of the simplest examples of a <strong><em>self-organizing</em></strong> system. I
find it really interesting as how unique yet different patterns emerge
from a simple set of rules and might be considered as a form of
<strong><em>mathematical beauty</em></strong>. However, did this help mathematicians or
scientists to understand the diversity of life that has evolved on
earth? Perhaps, but I do believe that <strong><em>Mother Nature</em></strong> is far more
complicated than that. However, it did help me realize that I have to
study and understand different patterns and behaviours in order to build
complex systems.</p>

<p>Studying the behavior of cells or animals using a simple set of rules
can help understand how things really work and this influences
scientists and engineers to come up with brilliant solutions to solve
existing problems in this world.</p>

<p>For example, studying the intelligent behavior of ants being able to
build complex ant colonies, trying to understand the cause of traffic
congestions and how to prevent them (which I will be talking about in
another post), finding the cure for cancer and many other human diseases
and so on.</p>

<p>Well, the point that I'm trying to make is, perhaps, the solution to all
of today's current problems could be hidden inside the patterns of this
simple game.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoyed reading this article!</p>

<p>Adios Amigo!</p>
