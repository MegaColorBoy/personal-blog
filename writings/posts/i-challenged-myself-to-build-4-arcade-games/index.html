		<p>Alas! It has been a long time since my last blog post.</p>

<p>Last month was the Holy Month of Ramadan, so I kept myself busy with my religious duties and it also kind of ruined my sleeping pattern, thus I was tired to post anything. Since I was pretty exhausted after that, I decided to take a week off from work to spend some time with my family and also thought of working on my side projects and then I realized that I need to set a personal challenge to get myself motivated for the month.</p>

<h2>What's the challenge?</h2>

<p>When I was building this blog, I had the intention of remaking arcade games and posting them over here for the visitors to come and play them! So since I had a week off from work, I challenged myself to build four arcade games this month and create a separate blog post for each game, where I would be talking about how it was built, it's history and it's game mechanics.</p>

<p>These are the list of games that I had planned to build/already built during this month:</p>

<ul>
<li>Snake</li>
<li>Breakout</li>
<li>Pong</li>
<li>Tetris</li>
</ul>

<h2>How did the challenge feel?</h2>

<p>Honestly, it was really refreshing and felt like a mini-hackathon. I was able to learn new things about <strong><em>Game Programming</em></strong> and <strong><em>2D Mathematics</em></strong> and as a result, I have upgraded my knowledge on <strong><em>Javascript</em></strong> as well. Although I told myself that I would build all of these games in a month, during my time off, I was able to build everything except <strong><em>Tetris</em></strong> as I'm still working on it. </p>

<h2>What's next?</h2>

<p>I know this is a short post but I'm working on the content for each blog post, so that it doesn't feel rushed! Once I have posted all of them, I'd like to know your views on each of them and it would be also nice if you could suggest any arcade games that I could remake!</p>

<p>Until next time, then!</p>
