		<h1>Writing a book on how to build ReactJS applications</h1>
		
			<p>I'm challenging myself to write a book on how to build simple applications using ReactJS</p>

		<p>Over the past few months, I've been spending some of my free time to learn ReactJS and I've got to say, I really like it and got a hang of it after lots of trials and errors.</p>

<p>Just to make it clear, I didn't become a ReactJS expert or something but I figured that writing a book on something that you've learnt would help you understand the material much more deeper.</p>

<p>And since I do believe in it, I decided to challenge myself to write a book on it.</p>

<h2>What's the aim of the book?</h2>

<p>I aim to cover the fundamentals and concepts of ReactJS using a progressive and an example-driven approach. You know like on how to write reusable UI components, handle user events and interactions and managing state and props of a component.</p>

<p>By the end of this book, the reader will have solid understanding of React's concepts and be able to build cool applications using it.</p>

<h2>When's it going to be released?</h2>

<p>Honestly, I didn't plan on the size of the book yet but the practical content for it i.e. the actual code and applications are ready. I aim to release it somewhere around <strong>late April 2020</strong>.</p>

<h2>Are you planning to monetize it?</h2>

<p>Umm, nope! I believe that knowledge should be accessible for everyone and I plan on making the book open source, so that it can get updated as per the latest changes.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I know it's a short article but I feel like I wanted to challenge myself with a small goal for this year.</p>

<p>Let's see how it goes!</p>
