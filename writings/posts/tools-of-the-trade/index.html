		<p>In our daily life, the tools we use do matter a lot, they help us solve problems, learn new things and complete our tasks. I usually read blogs of other programmers as well, by doing so, I get to learn about the different technologies and products they use and ultimately, it has helped me take inspiration to change myself too.</p>

<p>I thought of writing an article about the tools that I use on a regular basis, so here we go!</p>

<h2>Hardware</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="#iphone-5s">iPhone 5s</a></li>

<h3><a id="iphone-5s"></a> iPhone 5s</h3>

<p>I used to have a <strong><em>Samsung Galaxy Pocket</em></strong>, it was a really slow phone that made me hate Android OS. When I got the iPhone 5s, I never turned back. Not that I'm an Apple fanboy (Well, yes I am) but I believe it is one of Apple's best iPhones till date. The build quality is great. It's still one of those iPhones that has a headphone jack and also, it has a really nice form factor.</p>

<h3><a id="dell-xps-13"></a> Dell XPS 13 9360</h3>

<p>Before purchasing this laptop, I was going to buy a 13" MacBook Pro 2017 but the internet convinced me that it might not be the right choice as it had a lot of flaws like the unresponsive butterfly keyboard, less ports and in terms of specs, it was a bit outdated.</p>

<p>So I thought of going for my next choice with the following specs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intel i7 @ 2.4Ghz 7th Generation</li>
<li>256GB Solid State Drive</li>
<li>8GB RAM</li>
<li>13.3" Inch FHD Display</li>
</ul>

<p>It came with a bloated Windows 10 and then later, I replaced it with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, <a href="/posts/goodbye-windows-10/">you can read about it here</a>.</p>

<p>The laptop is very lightweight and portable. It has a really, really good display that is equivalent to the infamous Apple's Retina Display. Thanks to the specs, it runs really fast and I use it primarily for developing software.</p>

<p>If you are planning on getting one, I do recommend it!</p>

<h3><a id="apple-earphones"></a> Apple earphones</h3>

</figure>

<p>I got these earphones with my iPhone 5s, the sound quality is pretty decent and yes, it portable enough for me to listen to my favorite soundtracks on the go.</p>

<h3><a id="ubuntu"></a> Ubuntu 18.04 LTS</h3>

<figure>
    <img src="https://www.linuxnov.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Ubuntu-18-04-LTS-Bionic-Beaver-Screenshot.png"/>
</figure>

<p>I don't hate Windows, in fact, I do use it at work and for graphic design and entertainment purposes but I personally like using Linux as my development environment.</p>

<p>I chose Ubuntu because it has a strong community and compared to other distributions, it has good support for Dell XPS hardware.</p>

<p>Apart from that I've got three more things to say: Open source. Secure and Developer-Friendly.</p>

<h3><a id="sublime"></a> Sublime Text 3</h3>

<figure>
    <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wsldpcom/el/images/ubuntu/sublime/sublime-3-ubuntu.jpg"/>
</figure>

<p>I have been using Sublime Text since my university days, it's still one of my favorite text editors that I use at home and work. It has really good features such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Powerful keyboard shortcuts</li>
<li>Lightweight</li>
<li>Fast startup</li>
<li>Good selection of themes and configurable</li>
<li>Able to edit multiple lines at the same time</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh, I wrote this article on Sublime Text!</p>

<h3><a id="vim"></a> VIM</h3>

<figure>
    <img src="https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2018/08/f0b2038f-1024px-vim-logiciel-console-1024x609.png"/>
</figure>

<p>I read a lot of people talking about it and I thought giving it a shot to explore VIM and I must say, it's really a game changer.</p>

<p>Although, it's not an IDE like <strong><em>Emacs</em></strong> but it's quite a powerful text editor. It has really powerful keyboard shortcuts, it's configurable and it's quite handy if you wanted to edit any file on the terminal.</p>

<h3><a id="terminal"></a> Terminal</h3>

<figure>
    <img src="https://news-cdn.softpedia.com/images/news2/Ubuntu-Terminal-Reboot-Is-Probably-One-of-the-Coolest-Terminals-You-ve-Seen-468554-4.jpg"/>
</figure>

<p>Ahh, the terminal. The application that people instantly assumes that it's used for hacking. Well no, it's not only used for hacking.</p>

<p>Yes, it's cool to use and know the command-line but I use it to automate my tasks using Bash, SSH, updates and upgrades using apt-get, downloading packages and software, editing text using VIM and much more.</p>

<h3><a id="spotify"></a> Spotify</h3>

<figure>
    <img src="https://spotify.i.lithium.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/59445i6F374608C1FC9F0C/image-size/large?v=1.0&px=999"/>
</figure>

<p>Spotify wasn't available in the United Arab Emirates until November 2018. I use it during my coding sessions to stay focused. I'm a free user but I get to listen to all my favorite tracks. The AI recommended playlists are pretty cool too!</p>

<h3><a id="xampp"></a> XAMPP Control Panel</h3>

<figure>
    <img src="https://undsgn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/XAMPP-3.jpg"/>
</figure>

<p>Whenever I'm developing a PHP + MySQL web application, I use this as it comes with the Apache server. If you're using it on Linux, you might have to spend some time configuring the user access permissions.</p>

<h3><a id="chrome"></a> Google Chrome</h3>

<figure>
    <img src="https://mondrian.mashable.com/uploads%252Fcard%252Fimage%252F838813%252Feb915844-2a0d-40e5-ba74-5614edc74c11.jpg%252F950x534__filters%253Aquality%252890%2529.jpg?signature=Cofw_Z9okoU0wwgkN2u7XSVvLVI=&source=https%3A%2F%2Fblueprint-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com"/>
</figure>

<p>My preferred browser and I use it everyday. I love using the Inspect tool to debug JavaScript and CSS code.</p>

<p>It has good extensions for daily use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adblock </li>
<li>Postman</li>
<li>React Developer Tools</li>
<li>Amino: Live CSS Editor</li>
</ul>

<p>And yes, it does have a huge appetite for your RAM!</p>

<h3><a id="git"></a> Git</h3>

<figure>
    <img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*QoR3rxWIbnf5wmF_IuAHqQ.png"/>
</figure>

<p>I have heard of a lot of systems but using Git for code versioning and source control is pretty helpful especially if you want to host your projects or maintain your code portfolio on <strong><em>GitHub</em></strong>.</p>

<h3><a id="ai"></a> Adobe Illustrator</h3>

<figure>
    <img src="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/adobe-illustrator-cc/9780134664217/images/fmfig03.jpg"/>
</figure>

<p>I have been using it since I was 15 years old, I remember that one of first vector art was a gas mask and from there, I taught myself how to use different tools like the Pen Tool, the Shape Builder and much more. I don't think that there can be anyone that can top Illustrator in the Digital Design industry.</p>

<h3><a id="figma"></a> Figma</h3>

<figure>
    <img src="https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_1280,f_auto,q_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2018/03/p-1-as-design-and-engineering-merge-figma-is-becoming-a-platform-1.jpg"/>
</figure>

<p>When I was worried that <strong><em>Sketch</em></strong> is not available on Linux or Windows, I discovered Figma. It's one of the best UI tools that I have ever used. It helped me build my UI/UX skills really quick and I felt really comfortable designing user interfaces and components before actually coding it.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Just to make a note, these are my essential tools and this article is not intended to change your mind, your mileage can vary.</p>

<p>Hope you guys liked reading this article!</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more!</p>
