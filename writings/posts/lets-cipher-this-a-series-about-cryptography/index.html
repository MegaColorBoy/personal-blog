		<p>During this week, I was thinking about writing a very long blog post about Cryptography but then it would be too long for the readers that it might get them to feel bored. So, for starters, I thought about making a series of short blog posts called <strong><em>"Let's Cipher This"</em></strong> that would focus on the areas of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography">Cryptography</a>.</p>

<h2>What is it about?</h2>

<p>Well, the aim of this series is that I want to talk about Codes (I meant secret <strong><em>"codes"</em></strong>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher">Ciphers</a>, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>How they both work</li>
<li>How can they both be used to encrypt/decrypt messages</li>
<li>How to use different methods/strategies to break intercepted code</li>
</ul>

<h2>What's next?</h2>

<p>I know that there are a lot of simple and complex ciphers/crypto algorithmic techniques out there and I wanted to make each post as informative and interactive as possible i.e. by giving a detailed description about the cipher/technique, it's history, how it works and it's implementation, which can also be used as a tool for encrypting/decrypting your own messages.</p>

<p>The series is going to be a <strong><em>"Work in Progress"</em></strong>, so there won't be an ending to it as the field of the Cryptography is quite vast, deep and complex. I will be updating this series as often as I can, so watch out for new posts that are related to it!</p>
