		<p>When I converted my website to a static site using a custom-built static site generator using Python, I came across topics like <strong><em>"Hosting your website on GitHub Pages"</em></strong>. At the time, I thought that I didn't really need it because my website was hosted on <a href="https://www.hostinger.in">Hostinger</a> and it pretty much had everything that I needed until it started to get on my nerves.</p>

<p>Recently, my blog had been facing a lot of issues such as my website would face random downtime, hosting prices wasn't consistent and the FTP service for it was really annoying.</p>

<p>So, I decided that I need to find a better hosting service for my blog.</p>

<h2>Exploring GitHub Pages</h2>

<p>Setting up your website was pretty easy using GitHub Pages, all you have to do was create a repository named <mark>websitename.github.io</mark> and you're done.</p>

<p>Plus, unlike other hosting services, GitHub Pages hosts your website for free. That sounded like really amazing and it has really good security, caching and speed too.</p>

<p>However, it was my first choice and like every other free hosting services, it does come with a few drawbacks that didn't fit my requirements. GitHub Pages offers a bandwidth limit of <strong><em>1GB</em></strong> and it didn't have good custom domain support. Also, I read that it had weird caching issues once you commit your changes to your repository.</p>

<h2>Here comes, Netlify!</h2>

<p>When I discovered Netlify, I was happy because it had free hosting, good custom domain support and a <strong><em>100GB</em></strong> soft bandwidth, which is really fitting my requirements.</p>

<p>According to Netlify:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Make your site or web-app many times faster by bringing it closer to your users.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The cool thing is that your website is not only pushed to a single server but to a global network of CDN nodes that can handle operations like automatic caching, smart rewrite and redirect rules and yes, blazing, fast loading speeds.</p>

<p>Hosting your website on Netlify is simple as few clicks, all you have to do is upload your website on a Git repository then connect it to Netlify and it will deploy your website in less than 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Updating my blog is easier now as now I just have to push my new commits to my GitHub repo and Netlify would automatically deploy it. Goodbye, FTP!</p>

<h2>Configuring HTTPS and custom domain settings</h2>

<p>Since I have a custom domain, I configured my domain to point to Netlify's load balancer IP address by changing the <mark>A</mark> and <mark>CNAME</mark> records in the DNS Zone editor. The HTTPS/SSL part was a bit annoying and it took some time, like 5-6 hours, but apart from that, it was a great experience in migrating to Netlify.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In short, my blog's static files are hosted on GitHub and automatically deployed on Netlify for free. I do have some future plans, like trying to roll out a commenting engine and light/dark themes for the blog.</p>

<p>Hope you liked reading this article!</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>
