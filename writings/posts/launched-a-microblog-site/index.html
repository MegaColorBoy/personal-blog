		<p>Ever since I've been working from home (due to COVID19 pandemic), I hardly find time to write any posts on my blog and I felt that it was counter-productive whenever I wanted to start a new one after a long time.</p>

<p>And then, I came across this trend of <strong>TIL</strong> a.k.a <strong>Today I Learned</strong> on GitHub and one of my favorite ones is written by <a href="https://github.com/jbranchaud/til/blob/master/README.md">Josh Branchaud</a>.</p>

<h2>What is this about?</h2>

<p>Unlike writing long articles, which takes a lot of time, I believe that by having a microblog and writing short articles could help improve my productivity in writing.</p>

<p>So, I thought of sharing whatever I have learned on a day-to-day basis and accumulate this knowledge in a "repository" where anyone could learn from, thus is why I started this microblog. Besides, as of writing this article, I wrote 25 short articles in a month.</p>

<h2>What kind of articles can we expect?</h2>

<p>It'd be wonderful to say that I can talk about anything over here but currently, I'm restricting it to Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering and Digital Design.</p>

<h2>So what about your main blog?</h2>

<p>Oh, I'm not ignoring it! The main blog will be there but now that I have segregated it, it'll allow me to take some time to plan and write content-heavy articles. There'll be more articles coming in a few months time.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more!</p>
