		<p>Two weeks ago, I was thinking of making an improvement on my <a href="https://www.kit.ae">company
website</a>'s custom-built Content Management System
(CMS) in order to make it easier for my team to edit and push content
with ease.</p>

<p>As a matter of coincidence, I came across a book named <a href="http://www.designinginterfaces.com">Designing
Interfaces: Patterns for Effective Interaction
Design</a> by Jennifer Tidwell, which
contains several User Interface and Interaction Design patterns that
inspired me to implement one of the patterns that I had discovered in
the book, <strong><em>"Edit-in-Place"</em></strong>.</p>

<h2>What's Edit-in-Place?</h2>

<p>It's like a tiny WYSIWYG text-editor that allows users to change the
text directly on top of the original text instead of going through a
separate portal or dialog box.</p>

<h2>Why did I build it?</h2>

<p>The fact that my team has to navigate through a sea of pages in the CMS
to edit content is annoying and sometimes, it could be just opening a
lot of new tabs on the browser. Hence, a feature like this would allow
them to edit content <strong><em>"on-the-fly"</em></strong> with zero navigation.</p>

<p>Below, I have made an implementation of it using Javascript and an
experimental design for my blog.</p>

<p><strong>How to use Edit-in-Place:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Hover on top of any text element.</li>
<li>Double-click on the selected element.</li>
<li>Click <strong><em>Save</em></strong> to save changes.</li>
<li>Click <strong><em>Cancel</em></strong> to cancel changes.</li>
</ul>

<p>The book claims that <strong><em>Flickr</em></strong> is one of them who implemented this
feature, you can find this feature in most modern Content Management
Systems like Wordpress, Joomla or Drupal or a better example, you have
used this feature while renaming a file on your computer.</p>

<p>However, there are some limits to this i.e. you can only apply this
feature on dynamic webpages as you'll have to write a few additional
lines of <strong><em>AJAX</em></strong> that sends a <strong><em>POST</em></strong> request to your server to
reflect the saved changes on your database.</p>

<p>Hope you guys found this article useful!</p>
