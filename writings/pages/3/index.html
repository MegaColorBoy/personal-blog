		<p class="description">A little self-reflection on how writing TIL articles has improved my productivity and learning.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="article-body">
		<p>Last year, around this time, I was working from home due to the COVID-19 restrictions placed by the UAE Government.</p>

<p>During this time, I noticed that I ran out of ideas for my blog and didn't even get time to maintain it for a long time.</p>

<p>Then, I came across <a href="https://github.com/jbranchaud/til">Josh Branchaud's TIL collection</a>, which inspired me to start my own TIL section in my blog. At first, I had the idea of merging it with my main blog but then, I thought of keeping it separate and well, fast-forward to a year now, it's been one of the most productive platforms for writing short articles based on whatever I have learnt or solved.</p>

<p>As for those of you who might not know, TIL a.k.a stands for <strong>Today I Learned</strong> and what I really liked about it is that there isn't any barrier that stops you from writing a short article and that was the one thing that motivated me to write something on my blog.</p>

<h2>Has it helped it you?</h2>

<p>Yes, it did help me in two ways.</p>

<p>Professionally, it has motivated me to learn more about my field and share my knowledge about whatever I learned while solving a particular problem or a tip that I found useful. The idea was likened to a personal StackOverflow repository that I would often revisit to refresh my memory.</p>

<p>Personally, it helped me reflect my values as a programmer and made me realize that there's a lot of things to learn out there and it's pretty much endless as there's always something to learn every single day. And yes, it helped me improve my writing abilities too.</p>

<p>Although, this article resides in a what I would call it as a "Technical blog", I guess, this applies to everyone who wants to refresh their writing productivity and help them get started back on the tracks again.</p>

<p>Hope you liked reading this article.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more!</p>

		<p class="description">An insight into the three main email security protocols that protects your email from malicious attackers.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="article-body">
		<p>Today, email spam is one of the most common cyberattacks conducted by people with malicious intent intending to steal your passwords and personal credentials, leading users to phishing sites to steal bank account details, identity theft and so on.</p>

<p>Because of this, ISPs and email providers such as Gmail and Office 365 are taking anti-spam measures by enforcing stricter protocols in the type of emails that they receive, so it's good to implement those protocols and ensure that your email gets delivered and not delayed or worse, rejected by the mail servers.</p>

<h2>So, what are those protocols?</h2>

<p><a href="#spf-record">SPF</a>, <a href="#dkim-record">DKIM</a> and <a href="#dmarc-record">DMARC</a> are the three main secure protocols used to authenticate your mail server and this will prove the ISPs and other mail service providers that the mail being sent is legitimate and authorized.</p>

<h2><a id="spf-record"></a> What is SPF?</h2>

<p>It's an acronym for <strong>Sender Policy Framework</strong>. SPF is nothing but a DNS TXT record that specifies the server(s) and IP addresses that are allowed to send email from a specific domain.</p>

<p>Assuming you are the sender, just think of sending a postcard to your friend in which you add your address as well, so that your friend knows who the recipient is and he/she would most likely open it because they trust it.</p>

<p>But in technical terms, the actual recipient is not the user but rather the mail server that receives the mail.</p>

<h3>Create an SPF record</h3>

<p>An SPF record is a very simple string and it can be easily created. However, there are a few parts to it:</p>

<ol>
<li>Version of SPF used.</li>
<li>IP addresses that are authorized to send emails.</li>
<li>Third party domain(s) that are authorized to send emails.</li>
<li>An ending tag named "all" which tells the receiving server on what policy to apply if the sending server is not a part of the SPF record.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, let's what does it look like and what each part of it does:</p>

<div class="codehilite">
<pre><span></span><code>v=spf1 ip4:111.111.111.111 include:example-domain.com -all
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><code>v=spf1</code> states the SPF version being implemented. Currently, there's no any other version at this point. So, it should always stay as this version until another version is released.</p>

<p><code>ip4:111.111.111.111</code> is the IP address of the mail server/domain that's authorized to send emails for that domain. You can use multiple IP addresses and can be listed individually like this <code>ip4:111.111.111.111 ip4:222.222.222.222</code> or through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing">CIDR</a> like <code>ip4:111.111.111.0/20</code>. If both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are being used by mail server, make sure that both of those addresses are being listed.</p>

<p><code>include:example-domain.com</code> is a secondary domain that's authorized to send emails on behalf of the primary mail domain(s) listed. Just like the previous rule above, you can add multiple secondary domains but bear in mind that only a maximum of 10 domains are allowed for any sending domain.</p>

<p><code>-all</code> is a tag that instructs the receiving server on how to handle messages from a domain that isn't a part of the SPF record. There are some options and they are all dictated by a single character that precedes the <code>all</code> keyword. The options are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>-all</code> means hard fail. The receiving server should reject the email if the sender domain is not authorized.</li>
<li><code>~all</code> means soft fail. The receiving server can flag it as a possible spam if the sender domain is not authorized. </li>
<li><code>+all</code> means authorized. The receiving server allows the email even if the sender domain is not authorized. Now, this is not recommended and please do not use this option.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="dkim-record"></a> What is DKIM?</h2>

<p>It's an acronym for <strong>DomainKeys Identified Mail</strong> a.k.a Email signing. Just like <a href="#spf-record">SPF</a>, DKIM is also a simple DNS TXT record that tells the receiving server that the mail is certified which allows to build a trust between both the sending and receiving servers.</p>

<p>To handle this trust, DKIM makes uses of an RSA cryptographic algorithm to create a pair of <strong>public</strong> and <strong>private</strong> encryption keys. The private key will remain on the server (i.e. the mail server) whereas the public key is placed in your DNS records.</p>

<h2>How to create a DKIM record?</h2>

<p>Depending on your mail provider, it can be easily generated by tools provided by them and once generated, it can be copy-pasted to the DNS records.</p>

<p>This is how a typical DKIM record would look like:</p>

<div class="codehilite">
<pre><span></span><code>v=DKIM1; k=rsa;
p=iHeFQ+7rCiSQs3DPjR2eUSZSv4i/Kp+sipRfVH7BGf+SxcwOkX7X8R1RVObMQsFcbIxnrq7Ba2QCf0YZlL9iqJf32V+baDI8IykuDztuoNUF2Kk0pawZkbSPNHYRtLxV2CTOtc+x4eIeSeYptaiu7g7GupekLZ2DE1ODHhuP4I=
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Regardless of how it's being generated, this is what each part of the header means:</p>

<p><code>v=DKIM1</code> is the DKIM protocol version used.</p>

<p><code>p=</code> is the Base64 encoded public key generated.</p>

<p><code>k=</code> is the mechanism used to decode the DKIM signature. The encryption key is usually based on <code>rsa-sha1</code> or <code>rsa-sha256</code> signing algorithm.</p>

<p>You can use DMARC analyzer's <a href="https://dmarcanalyzer.com/dkim/dkim-checker">DKIM checker</a> to check if your DKIM record is valid.</p>

<h2><a id="dmarc-record"></a> What is DMARC?</h2>

<p>It's an acronym for <strong>Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance</strong>. This protocol is built around SPF and DKIM and it ensures the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Verifies that the sender's email is protected by SPF and DKIM protocols.</li>
<li>Instructs the receiving mail server on what to do if the authentication fails.</li>
<li>Provides a way for the receiving server to send a report to the sender about the DMARC evaluation i.e. whether it passed or failed.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have come this far in the article, you might have understood why both <a href="#spf-record">SPF</a> and <a href="#dkim-record">DKIM</a> were explained and why they are quite necessary.</p>

<h2>How to create a DMARC record?</h2>

<p>Once you have both SPF and DKIM records in place, then it's easy to create your DMARC record. There are many sites and I would recommend you to try MXToolbox's <a href="https://mxtoolbox.com/DMARCRecordGenerator.aspx">DMARC Record Generator</a>.</p>

<p>This is how a DMARC record would look like:</p>

<div class="codehilite">
<pre><span></span><code>v=DMARC1; p=none; fo=1; rua=mailto:address@example.com;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>And here's what each part of the header translates to:</p>

<p><code>v</code> is the version tag, similar to the SPF record. It should always be <code>DMARC1</code> in the record.</p>

<p><code>p</code> is the policy tag. <code>none</code> means to not do anything to the email, <code>quarantine</code> means to flag it as spam and <code>reject</code> means to reject the email.</p>

<p><code>fo</code> is the tag that lets the receiving servers know that failed messages must be returned to the sender or not. There are four values for this tag:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>0</code>: Generate a report if both DKIM and SPF produce a "Pass" result.</li>
<li><code>1</code>: Generate a report if both DKIM and SPF produce a result other than "Pass".</li>
<li><code>d</code>: Generate a report if the email had failed the DKIM evaluation.</li>
<li><code>s</code>: Generate a report if the email had failed the SPF evaluation.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's actually recommended to use <code>fo=1</code> which can help you look for any email delivery issues.</p>

<p><code>rua</code> tells the receiving server on where to send the aggregate reports. This could provide insights into the health of the email server and can help identify any malicious activities.</p>

<p>There are many optional tags that can be used but these are the tags are most commonly used by default.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>With the increase in spam emails, it's good to take such preventive measures to ensure that you are following best practices and doing your part to prevent malicious emails and other security related issues.</p>

		<p class="description">By modifying my old random pixel generator, I was able to generate a Space Invaders-esque pixel art.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="article-body">
		<p><canvas id="myCanvas" width="500" height="302" style="border:0px solid #40514e;background-color: #e4f9f5;"></canvas></p>

<div class="post-notification success">
    <h3>Try it out!</h3>
    <p>Refresh the page to generate unique Space Invader-esque patterns as the results are unpredictable!</p>
</div>

<p>Generative art is a topic that still fascinates me because of the fact that you can produce something unique by just writing few (sometimes, more) lines of code. Especially, if it's self-generating art that makes use of fixed rules and a slight dash of randomness to produce unique results.</p>

<p>When it comes to writing code, it's quite straightforward. You come up with the rules and constraints and voila, you have something that works. Having said that, setting up rules for generative art can get quite tricky.</p>

<p>You might have read about my previous post about <a href="/writings/posts/the-game-of-life/">The Game of Life</a>, it contains only four rules and each of them took a part in evolving the system through each generation. With generative systems like that, you can never predict the results as complex patterns will emerge due to it's randomness.</p>

<p>In my view, a combination of predictability and randomness is needed in order to create a good looking generative art.</p>

<h2>Why you should explore it?</h2>

<p>There could be many reasons, maybe you're bored, curious or passionate to learn something new. Who knows? Open up your editor and try it for yourself.</p>

<p>Exploring the craft of making generative art has allowed me to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gain different experiences &mdash; It allows you to sharpen your algorithms &amp; data structures and maybe even, learn a new technique.</li>
<li>Create something visually appealing &mdash; A picture is equal to a thousand words.</li>
<li>Instant results that makes you feel good &mdash; I mean, it's hard to explain but y'know what I mean, right?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where to start?</h2>

<p>Just like any other project, you just need:</p>

<ul>
<li>An inspiration or an idea that you can work on.</li>
<li>The right kind of technology to use.</li>
</ul>

<p>With today's article, I'll be showing you how I built a Space Invader-esque pixel art generator in JavaScript that makes use of the Canvas API.</p>

<h2>Building a generator</h2>

<p>I'd like to give a shout out to the <a href="https://www.erdavids.com/">person</a> who built a twitterbot that generates random sprites using Python's Pillow image library.</p>

<p>I was inspired and I thought of writing it in JavaScript and as you can see above, it did turn out pretty well.</p>

<p>Here's the code for your reference and please read the comments to know how it functions:</p>

<p>Well, I won't say that is a perfect solution but hey, it works and yes, it doesn't take a lot of code to achieve something like this.</p>

<h2>Explanation</h2>

<p>I'll try my best to explain how this whole thing works.</p>

<p>First, you need to initialize a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> DOM element of the desired width and height. Then in the <code>main()</code> function, you determine the size of each invader by specifying the number of invaders and dividing it with the width of the canvas. These values will then be used to determine the coordinates for each invader.</p>

<p>Second, the function <code>createInvader()</code> follows nearly the same process as the <code>main</code> function except that the coordinates for each pixel is determined by calculating the width of the invader and subtracting it's <code>x</code> position divided by the dimensions of each invader.</p>

<p>Third, as you can see in the function <code>createSquare()</code>, it contains 3 simple rules in which all of them draws a square with a color but with an emphasis that each invader has a symmetrical pattern.</p>

<p>The code looks deceptively simple but achieving this complexity did take a lot of trial and error and a little bit of simple calculus &#x1F602;.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Generative art might be something that you may not need to explore but it's quite fun and you may never know what you might be able to produce by combining both code and visuals.</p>

		<p class="description">Thought of giving it some new upgrades and finally decided to open-source it.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="article-body">
		<p>Since <a href="/writings/posts/build-your-own-static-site-generator-using-python/">2019</a>, I always used a custom static site generator for the website. The previous one was written in Python 2.7 but ever since Python decided to <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/">sunset</a> it, I decided to rewrite it using Python 3.7.</p>

<p>Unlike the previous one, it's quite flexible and I thought of giving it some new features that would help me maintain it with ease.</p>

<p>The new features I have added are:</p>

<ul>
<li>A neat CLI to build the entire site or certain parts of the website</li>
<li>Able to switch between different templates </li>
<li>Archive mode</li>
<li>Pagination</li>
<li>Generates RSS Feeds and JSON files</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why rewrite it again?</h2>

<p>Over the past few months, I didn't really maintain my blog and when I visited the old codebase, I realized it wasn't flexible and it didn't have many features and it was slow, too.</p>

<p>Recently, I got new ideas of building different sections for the website and thus, is why I had the motivation to rewrite everything and make it modular and flexible enough to build a powerful yet simple custom static site generator.</p>

<h2>Have a look</h2>

<p>I have decided to open-source my static site generator on my <a href="https://www.github.com/megacolorboy/megacolorboy-ssg">GitHub repository</a> and I'm having plans of writing a new documentation for it, so that if people are interested, they could contribute or use it for their own personal uses.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you've been following my blog posts, you may know that I have a knack of displaying JavaScript widgets on some of my previous blog posts. Well, I've decided to rewrite all of those widgets, one-by-one, using ReactJS and hopefully, write more tutorials for each of them.</p>

		<p class="description">Did a little digging on whether it's useful to make use of pointers in your application</p>
	</div>
	<div class="article-body">
		<p>The topic about pointers isn't new as you're probably introduced to this concept in your first computer science class. I started learning Go and once again, I came across the concept of using Pointers and wanted to finally understand, why are they used and do we really need to use it?</p>

<p>Frankly, I don't really remember using pointers when I was developing web applications in PHP and JavaScript but it was quite a refresher to get back on track again.</p>

<h2>Well, what is a pointer?</h2>

<p>In it's basic form, a pointer is a variable that contains the memory address of another variable.</p>

<p>For example, you have a variable named <mark>x</mark> that contains some data, in this case, we'll store an integer:</p>

<p>The code above prints the variable <mark>x</mark> by referring to it's name. We can do the same using pointers by referring to it's memory address via another variable that points to variable <mark>x</mark>.</p>

<p>To do this, we must use <mark>&amp;</mark> operator to get the address and <code>*</code> to return the value stored in the address of variable <mark>x</mark> like this:</p>

<div class="codehilite">
<pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">package</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">main</span>

<span class="kn">import</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">&quot;fmt&quot;</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Hmm, that was pretty straight forward.</p>

<h2>So, why was it created?</h2>

<p>In the modern era, most high-level programming languages are capable of handling memory allocation (like <strong>Java</strong> or <strong>C#</strong>), automatically.</p>

<p>But when <strong>C</strong> was developed, computers weren't as powerful as today but that also meant the programmers must create systems that made use of memory and speed, efficiently. Which is why some tasks do require it when programming low-level embedded systems or microcontrollers.</p>

<h2>Why use them?</h2>

<p>Whenever you pass a variable to a function, you're basically creating a copy of the variable. But if you're using pointers, you just have to pass the address of the variable and in most cases, a pointer is much smaller in size than the value being pointed at.</p>

<p>It allows you share data and it's quite appropriate when it comes to modifying the data being passed to it.</p>

<p>To some extent, it might seem efficient but there are some tradeoffs, when you're going to talk about optimization.</p>

<h2>Do pointers really optimize your application?</h2>

<p>I was thinking if pointers are used to optimize applications, I mean, you don't have to duplicate data and it saves memory, so why not?</p>

<p>Turns out that there are a few points that I came across:</p>

<ol>
<li>Accessing values can use up memory though not so much but it can add up.</li>
<li>Data will be placed on top of heap stack which increases the memory overhead and can be cleaned up the garbage collector.</li>
</ol>

<p>Most programmers tend to avoid using it in order to make their codebase less complex and reduce the increased work for the garbage collector.</p>

<p>Apart from that, there are some concerns when it comes to the security of the application implying that it could be unsafe when using pointers.</p>

<h2>Takeaway</h2>

<p>Pointers are useful but don't think of using it, blindly, by assuming that it might give you a boost in performance.</p>

<p>Hope you found this article useful!</p>

		<p class="description">A tiny experiment to see how it could improve my writing productivity.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="article-body">
		<p>Ever since I've been working from home (due to COVID19 pandemic), I hardly find time to write any posts on my blog and I felt that it was counter-productive whenever I wanted to start a new one after a long time.</p>

<p>And then, I came across this trend of <strong>TIL</strong> a.k.a <strong>Today I Learned</strong> on GitHub and one of my favorite ones is written by <a href="https://github.com/jbranchaud/til/blob/master/README.md">Josh Branchaud</a>.</p>

<h2>What is this about?</h2>

<p>Unlike writing long articles, which takes a lot of time, I believe that by having a microblog and writing short articles could help improve my productivity in writing.</p>

<p>So, I thought of sharing whatever I have learned on a day-to-day basis and accumulate this knowledge in a "repository" where anyone could learn from, thus is why I started this microblog. Besides, as of writing this article, I wrote 25 short articles in a month.</p>

<h2>What kind of articles can we expect?</h2>

<p>It'd be wonderful to say that I can talk about anything over here but currently, I'm restricting it to Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering and Digital Design.</p>

<h2>So what about your main blog?</h2>

<p>Oh, I'm not ignoring it! The main blog will be there but now that I have segregated it, it'll allow me to take some time to plan and write content-heavy articles. There'll be more articles coming in a few months time.</p>

<p><a href="../../til">Click here</a> to view my microblog and let me know what you think about it! &#x1F604;</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more!</p>

		<p class="description">I'm challenging myself to write a book on how to build simple applications using ReactJS</p>
	</div>
	<div class="article-body">
		<p>Over the past few months, I've been spending some of my free time to learn ReactJS and I've got to say, I really like it and got a hang of it after lots of trials and errors.</p>

<p>Just to make it clear, I didn't become a ReactJS expert or something but I figured that writing a book on something that you've learnt would help you understand the material much more deeper.</p>

<p>And since I do believe in it, I decided to challenge myself to write a book on it.</p>

<h2>What's the aim of the book?</h2>

<p>I aim to cover the fundamentals and concepts of ReactJS using a progressive and an example-driven approach. You know like on how to write reusable UI components, handle user events and interactions and managing state and props of a component.</p>

<p>By the end of this book, the reader will have solid understanding of React's concepts and be able to build cool applications using it.</p>

<h2>When's it going to be released?</h2>

<p>Honestly, I didn't plan on the size of the book yet but the practical content for it i.e. the actual code and applications are ready. I aim to release it somewhere around <strong>late April 2020</strong>.</p>

<h2>Are you planning to monetize it?</h2>

<p>Umm, nope! I believe that knowledge should be accessible for everyone and I plan on making the book open source, so that it can get updated as per the latest changes.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I know it's a short article but I feel like I wanted to challenge myself with a small goal for this year.</p>

<p>Let's see how it goes!</p>

		<p class="description">Sharing my experiences of using events and listeners in my Laravel application.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="article-body">
		<p>Recently, I have started learning Laravel and now, I'm building an application for my new company using this amazing framework.</p>

<p>My senior developer was curious and thought of having a conversation with me that went like this:</p>

<div class="codehilite">
<pre><span></span><code>Senior dev: Hmm, can I have a look at your code?

Me: Oh sure, here take a look.

Senior: (Goes through project file structure)

Senior: So, have you ever thought of using events in your application?

Me: Yeah, I wrote a custom JavaScript file to handle and fire events on the client-side like validating the forms and passing async requests to the server.

Senior: Hmm, that&#39;s okay but I&#39;m talking using events in Laravel.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>At this point, I was pretty clueless and I didn't know what the heck was going on. Events in PHP? I mean, I know about it in JavaScript because of it's event-driven architecture that we are all familiar with. But in PHP? I didn't know that.</p>

<p>Still confused, he proceeds to explain about it's concepts in an abstract manner and thanks to him, it induced my curiosity by asking myself: <strong><em>What's the deal in between using events over function calls using a route on a standard controller?</em></strong></p>

<p>In today's article, I'll be talking about why and when to use events over function calls using Laravel in your application.</p>

<h2>What's an event?</h2>

<p>An event is a piece of reusable logic stored somewhere in your application that has a set of listeners waiting to be executed, if triggered.</p>

<p>Let's say, you have a simple CRUD application that involves user registration. Whenever a user registers, you may want to perform certain actions, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adding them into your mailing list</li>
<li>Confirmation of account</li>
</ul>

<p>You can add more but this is just to give you an idea. Let's see take a look at two different approaches:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="#approach-1">Functional</a></li>
<li><a href="#approach-2">Events and Listeners</a></li>
</ol>

<h3><a id="approach-1"></a> Functional</h3>

<p>If you're using an MVC framework (Laravel, in our case), you'd do this in a controller with a bunch of methods like so:</p>

<div class="codehilite">
<pre><span></span><code><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">namespace</span> <span class="nx">App\Http\Controllers</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">use</span> <span class="nx">App\Http\Controllers\Controller</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">use</span> <span class="nx">App\User</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">UserController</span> <span class="k">extends</span> <span class="nx">Controller</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">index</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="c1">// insert code to view users page</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">Request</span> <span class="nv">$request</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nv">$arr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
            <span class="s1">&#39;username&#39;</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nv">$request</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">username</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="s1">&#39;email&#39;</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nv">$request</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">email</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="s1">&#39;password&#39;</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nx">bcrypt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;something&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="p">];</span>

        <span class="nv">$user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">User</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="na">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$arr</span><span class="p">);</span>

        <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">sendConfirmationEmail</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$user</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">subscribeToMailingList</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$user</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="c1">// Send confirmation email to user</span>
    <span class="k">private</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">sendConfirmationEmail</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$user</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="c1">// insert code</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="c1">// Subscribe user to mailing list</span>
    <span class="k">private</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">subscribeToMailingList</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$user</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="c1">// insert code</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This is approach is self-contained and simple to follow but you're also adding in a lot of responsibility to your controller.</p>

<p>Not only that, what if the user wants to register from another place in your application, in that case, you'll have to duplicate your logic in multiple places.</p>

<h3><a id="approach-2"></a> Events and Listeners</h3>

<p>Using this approach, you can split this into <mark>Event</mark> and <mark>Listener</mark> files in your application.</p>

<div class="codehilite">
<pre><span></span><code><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">namespace</span> <span class="nx">App\Http\Controllers</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">use</span> <span class="nx">App\Http\Controllers\Controller</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">use</span> <span class="nx">App\User</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">UserController</span> <span class="k">extends</span> <span class="nx">Controller</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">index</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="c1">// insert code to view users page</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">Request</span> <span class="nv">$request</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nv">$arr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
            <span class="s1">&#39;username&#39;</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nv">$request</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">username</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="s1">&#39;email&#39;</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nv">$request</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">email</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="s1">&#39;password&#39;</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nx">bcrypt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;something&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="p">];</span>

        <span class="nv">$user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">User</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="na">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$arr</span><span class="p">);</span>

        <span class="c1">// Emit event</span>
        <span class="nx">event</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">UserRegistered</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$user</span><span class="p">));</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This is how your <mark>UserRegistered</mark> event would look like:</p>

<div class="codehilite">
<pre><span></span><code><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">namespace</span> <span class="nx">App\Events</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">use</span> <span class="nx">Illuminate\Queue\SerializeModels</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">use</span> <span class="nx">App\User</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">UserRegistered</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">use</span> <span class="nx">SerializesModels</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="nv">$user</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="fm">__construct</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">User</span> <span class="nv">$user</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$user</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>And this is how your <mark>SendConfirmationEmail</mark> listener would look like:</p>

<div class="codehilite">
<pre><span></span><code><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">namespace</span> <span class="nx">App\Listeners</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">use</span> <span class="nx">App\Events\UserRegistered</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">SendConfirmationEmail</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="fm">__construct</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">User</span> <span class="nv">$user</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="c1">// insert code</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="k">public</span> <span class="k">function</span> <span class="nf">handle</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">UserRegister</span> <span class="nv">$event</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="c1">// insert code</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Using this approach, you can use the <mark>UserRegistered</mark> event anywhere you wanted in your application. No matter what happens, it will trigger the same actions as it was intended to do so. If you want to add a new functionality, create a new listener and register it with the event in your <mark>EventServiceProvider</mark> file like this:</p>

<div class="codehilite">
<pre><span></span><code><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="k">protected</span> <span class="nv">$listen</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="s1">&#39;App\Events\UserRegistered&#39;</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="s1">&#39;App\Listeners\SendConfirmationEmail&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="p">],</span>
<span class="p">];</span>
<span class="cp">?&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If you follow this approach, your logic complexity is toned down and the controller will have less responsibility.</p>

<h2>Why use events and listeners over function calls?</h2>

<p>Just like this answer that I found on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4503723/why-use-event-listeners-over-function-calls">StackOverflow</a> question regarding events and listeners over calling functions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You might not be in control of the code that's doing the calling. Or even if you are, you don't want to introduce dependencies into that code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Think about it, what if you built an API or library that you want people to use but don't want them to modify the source code. Instead, you could provide a documentation that states specific events are raised under specific circumstances, in turn, they can write code that responds to such events.</p>

<p>I'm sure that there are more examples as to where this methodology might be applied.</p>

<h2>When to use it?</h2>

<p>Truth be told, it depends. If you have a simple application, then a functional approach is all you need but it's a larger and more complicated application, using Events and Listeners can be a better option.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Please note, I'm not an expert at this topic as I'm still learning and I thought of sharing what I had learnt. If you have any suggestions or thoughts, please share it with me on <a href="https://twitter.com/megacolorboy">Twitter</a> or <a href="mailto:megacolorboy@gmail.com">send me</a> a message to my inbox.</p>
