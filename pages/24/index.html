		<p class="description">Writing out my thoughts on eradicating traffic congestion in highly populated cities.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="article-body">
		<p>Whether it's being implemented or not, I have been thinking on how we
could use <strong><em>Computer Vision</em></strong> to solve traffic congestion.</p>

<p>Since, I live in the <strong><em>United Arab Emirates</em></strong>, I have always observed
that people who commute from <strong><em>Sharjah</em></strong> to <strong><em>Dubai</em></strong> and vice-versa
face a lot of traffic jams despite all the new roads and toll-gates
(yes, I don't seem to understand how does that solve the problem).</p>

<figure>

    <figcaption>

    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Well, the problem is not only faced in this country but many countries
such as China, Indonesia and so on.</p>

<h2>What are the causes of traffic congestion?</h2>

<p>Anyways, I jotted down some facts to consider what causes traffic
congestion in the first place:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tail-gating</li>
<li>Inconsistent travel speeds</li>
<li>Uneven vehicular distances</li>
<li>Spontaneous accidents and road rages</li>
<li>Changing from one lane to another</li>
<li>Increase in car population</li>
<li>Peak hours i.e. people going to work and leaving from work</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sure that there could be more but these are the facts that I can
come up with for now.</p>

<h2>How can Computer Vision solve this problem?</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision">Computer Vision</a> is a
field that intersects with multiple areas of technologies in which it
aims to develop an understanding of objects by extracting information
from various digital media sources like images and videos and automate
those tasks that a normal human would do in their daily lives.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://www.onlinebooksreview.com/uploads/blog_images/2018/04/16_computer_vision.jpg"/>
    <figcaption>
        Visualization of Computer Vision.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are various types of problems that Computer Vision algorithms are
able to solve but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Object Recognition or Object Classification</li>
<li>Identification of Objects</li>
<li>Object Detection</li>
<li>Analysis of Motion</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, it's not only about implementing these <strong><em>CNN</em></strong>-based
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">Convolutional Neural
Network</a>)
algorithms but you also need hardware to be able to compute and process
data. </p>

<h2>How would this work?</h2>

<p>There are two scenarios that I had thought while writing this article
and I hope that I'm able to translate my thoughts into accurate
examples.</p>

<p>Let's pretend we have four car drivers: Alex, Bob, Charlie and Dylan.</p>

<h3>Speed-Distance equilibrium</h3>

<p>Alex, Bob and Charlie are driving on the same lane. Alex hits the brake
slowly to shift to another lane, the sensors of Bob's car detects a
change in speed in Alex's car, Bob's car adjusts it's speed to match
Alex's current speed based on the variables of distance and travel time,
Charlie's car adapts the changes of Bob's car and thus, it's a chain
reaction.</p>

<h3>Shifting from one lane to another</h3>

<p>Alex is driving in Lane A and Dylan is driving in Lane B. Alex wants to
shift to Lane B, so he switches on the indicator and Dylan's car sensors
identify that Alex's car wants to change lanes. So Dylan's car slows
down and Alex is able to shift lanes with ease. I thought of it to be
some sort of a <strong><em>"elastic"</em></strong> effect when this occurs.</p>

<p>Well, you might argue that some cars have a system called <strong><em>"Cruise
Control"</em></strong> but here's the part that I'm trying to pitch, as I had
mentioned above, I just wanted to integrate sensors to the front and
rear sides of a vehicle, which means that these sensors can be
integrated in almost any vehicle.</p>

<h2>How is this going to be helpful?</h2>

<p>For starters, traffic congestion will gradually reduce, if not, be
eliminated but there are other beneficial factors to it, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Less fuel consumption</li>
<li>Less time is required to reach a destination</li>
<li>No tail-gating</li>
<li>Could prevent major road accidents</li>
</ul>

<p>However, if the sensors fail to work, the car driver will still be safe
because it's surrounded by other cars that have the sensors. This made
me think of another question, does that mean do all cars require sensors
or only a few? I find it quite intriguing.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Although, these sensors might require a vehicle to have some intelligent
capabilities, it may not require the type of network found in an
autonomous vehicle.</p>

</figure>

<p>The idea of placing sensors in the front and rear of a vehicle can
optimize the flow of traffic and thus, it might help eliminate traffic
congestion.</p>

		<p class="description">Basically, a minimal blog engine with a paper-like user interface with better enhancements.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="article-body">
		<div class="post-notification">
    <h3>Blog engine updated!</h3>
    <p>As of March 1st 2019, I have changed my blog engine from a dynamic website to a custom-built static site generator. <a href="../writings/posts/say-hello-new-blog/">Read more &rarr;</a></p>
</div>

<p>Whenever I'm writing a new blog post, I would write it using HTML on my
text editor i.e. using <strong><em>Sublime Text</em></strong> and copy-paste the source code
into my blog engine and hit "Submit" and that was really annoying.</p>

<p>You might be thinking to yourself as to why I'm putting myself through
such a tedious process to write a blog article when there are several
<strong><em>WYSIWYG</em></strong> text editor plugins.</p>

<p>Truth is, I have to admit that I was lazy and I cared a lot about
writing my blog articles but never cared about the tool I had built that
to write my blog articles, so I decided to upgrade it and make it even
better than what it was previously!</p>

<h2>Why rewrite it?</h2>

<p>For starters, the old one had a clunky and pretty much boring user
interface. I used <strong><em>CKEditor</em></strong> text editor plugin but to be honest, I
rarely used any of it's features as I was just directly copy-pasting my
source code from Sublime Text to the text field box.</p>

<p>Over time, it became slow due to spaghetti code and it required a lot of
code refactoring as I wrote this code during my earlier days of
programming by following various programming tutorials.</p>

<p>Here's some screenshots of the old blog engine:</p>

</figure>

<figure>
    <img src="/static/images/be-v1-3.png" />
    <figcaption>
    Fig.3: Edit page
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And, last but not the least, it didn't make me feel like I was writing a
blog but rather felt like writing HTML code in a more tedious manner.</p>

<h2>Time for a change!</h2>

<p>For the past two weeks, I have been working on a new version of the blog
engine and I had decided to give it some new features like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clean and paper-like user interface by taking inspiration from Google's Material Theming Design guidelines</li>
<li>Minimal text editor built from scratch that can be extensible in the future</li>
<li>Auto-save article every minute</li>
<li>Emojis, LaTeX syntax, JavaScript files and IFRAME windows</li>
<li>Live search bar to filter articles by keywords or categories</li>
</ul>

<p>In case, you're wondering, I built this using vanilla JavaScript and a
custom-built MVC PHP framework with a MySQL database.</p>

<p>Here's some screenshots of the new blog engine:</p>

    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>What I really wanted to achieve with the new blog engine is that I want
to give myself an enjoyable writing experience besides, this blog post
was written from the new blog engine.</p>

<p>Well, it's stable as of yet but I need to run a few tests and build more
functionalities before deploying it on my production server and finally
saying good-bye to the old version.</p>

		<p class="description">Can seeing things from another's perspective create empathy and help solve technical challenges?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="article-body">
		<p>Recently, I've started reading this book named <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/designing-for-emotion">Designing For
Emotion</a> by
<a href="http://aarronwalter.com/">Aarron Walter</a> and I've made it a point to
read it during my free time and so far I have completed three chapters
of the book.</p>

<p>In the first chapter of the book, I found a really interesting sentence,
written by the author:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Keep in mind that ignoring human needs is not a history we are doomed
  to repeat. Through our designs, we can see and connect with other
  human beings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you think a good software builds strong connections with other human
beings? Well, we have good examples like Facebook, Google, Netflix, and
Microsoft are proof that they have a massive pool of audience who likes
to use their products on a daily basis.</p>

<p>In this article, I will share some of my thoughts on how empathy can be
used to build and design powerful applications.</p>

<h2>User Interface Matters</h2>

<p>To any user, whatever is displayed on the application matters the most,
in this case, it's the <strong><em>User Interface</em></strong> of an application. If it
doesn't allow a user to perform their desired task, it will end up in
their Recycle Bin.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://cdn.cultofmac.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Ping-780x604.jpg"/>
    <figcaption>
        Fig. 1: Apple's Ping
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are many examples in the book and one of the examples is about
<strong><em>Apple's Ping</em></strong> (refer to Fig. 1), which was an attempt in creating a
social network on <strong><em>iTunes</em></strong> but it turned out to be unsuccessful as
users learned that they weren't able to share songs on Facebook or
Twitter and it lacked basic features. As a result, users didn't come
back to it again.</p>

<p>In my opinion, a good user interface should be relatively easy to use
and be more reliable in terms of pagespeed or simple and easy navigation
for the user. I mean, think about it, if your user is able to complete
their desired task and that puts a smile on their face, the user will
share their experiences to their friends and you'll get more people to
use your application, thus making your application more powerful.</p>

<h2>A Universal Design</h2>

<p>A door knob comes with multiple designs such as rotating knobs and
levers but what matters the most to the people? The design or the
functionality? I personally prefer a lever knob over a rotating knob as
I find it quite annoying. Weird analogy but the point is, it should just
open the door, nothing fancy.</p>

<p>Similarly, when we build our software, by following proper techniques,
we can choose to make it beautiful but also choose to make it accessible
and functional for everybody, at all costs.</p>

<h2>Listen to your users</h2>

<p>When building and designing a piece of code, it should and always be for
the people that uses or will use your product. By understanding what's
important to the users, it can help you get to the core of the problem
and surpass technical challenges easily.</p>

<p>This can be achieved by gathering user requirements in the form of
surveys, user feedback and A/B testing. Remember, software is just an
expressive form of bringing your ideas to life and writing code is
building on top of the idea to achieve a certain goal but empathy is the
secret sauce to the success of your application.</p>

<h2>UX is not UI</h2>

<p>What's the first thing that comes to your mind when a friend of yours
tells you: <em>"Hey, I'm working as a UX Designer at UberCoolCorp!"</em>? Does
he build User Interfaces? Is he a Visual Graphics Designer? Neither,
actually!</p>

<p>User Experience is not about how your application looks but how it feels
and makes it simple and easier to interact with your users. I'd like to
share an interesting quote from Usabilla's UX Expert, Erik Flowers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>UX is the intangible design of a strategy that brings us to a
  solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>User Experience encompasses a lot of elements such as Information
Architecture, Interaction Design, Usability, Product Design and so on.
Below is a picture for your reference about why User Experience is not
User Interface:</p>

    <img src="http://www.uxisnotui.com/downloads/with-title.png"/>
    <figcaption>
        Fig. 2: How UX wants to be seen.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Although, it does have a lot of elements, UI is a huge part of the
design process because strong visual aesthetics are still essential in
UX, which is also one of the aspects of your user's interactions with
the application.</p>

<h2>Progressive Enhancement</h2>

<p>A strategy that is known to take you on journey from simplicity to
complexity. It's about starting off with a strong, practical foundation
and then building on top of it. It's easier to maintain and make small
yet incremental changes, renders the application to be more robust and
it works for all users.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Well, I'm sure there a lot of elements to this topic but I thought of
highlighting some of the most important parts of building and designing
software with empathy. As engineers or developers, it is our job to
ensure that our final product is usable and accessible to our end-user.</p>

		<p class="description">How to generate the next permutation of any given sequence in lexicographical order.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="article-body">
		<p>According to <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=24">Problem 24</a> in Project Euler, you are asked to find the millionth permutation using the following sequence of 10 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). Well, if you do the math, there are around <strong><em>10! = 3,628,800 unique permutations</em></strong> and that means, you have to come up with an efficient algorithm.</p>

<p>I tried writing a recursive function but it turned out to be a bit tricky, so I thought of writing a brute-force solution which seemed far more simpler to understand and it's quite efficient.</p>

<h2>Algorithm Description</h2>

<p>The following algorithm is quite simple and easy to understand:</p>

<div class="codehilite">
<pre><span></span><code>1. Find i such that a[i-1] is greater than or equal to a[i].
2. Find j such that a[j-1] is less than or equal to a[i-1].
3. Swap a[i] with a[j].
4. Reverse the suffix from a[i+1] to the last element.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Suppose, if the first step fails, it means the current permutation is the last one because such an index that does not exist. However, it's simple to implement the following algorithm correctly and efficiently, so let's take a look at the implementation.</p>

<h2>Python Implementation</h2>

<p>The following method only generates the next permutation of any given sequence, so if you're interested in generating all the permutations, especially, for very large lists, this function can be useful.</p>

<p><strong>Implementation of the method(s):</strong></p>

<div class="codehilite">
<pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># Swap numbers in a list</span>

		<p class="description">Rather than sticking to using a brute force solution, I decided to find the 1000 digit fibonacci number using the Golden Ratio.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="article-body">
		<p>Back in February, I said that I'm going to start <a href="/posts/i-decided-to-learn-python">solving Project Euler
problems using Python</a> and yes, I
have been doing it actively but sometimes, I don't find the time to post
the solutions.</p>

<p>If you're someone who has tried Project Euler before, you'll know that
you'll get to encounter problems that require you to implement smart
solutions to crunch big numbers efficiently. One of those problems is
<a href="https://www.projecteuler.net/problem=25">Problem 25</a>, which states to
find the first term in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci
Sequence</a> that contains
1000 digits.</p>

<p>This problem can be easily solved using a Brute Force solution, instead,
I opted to try out a mathematical solution that makes use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio">Golden
Ratio</a> and also, it gave me
the perfect excuse to try writing those formulas using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a> markup.</p>

<h2>What is Golden Ratio?</h2>

<p>Famously known as <strong><em>Phi</em></strong> that represents the Golden Ratio is an
irrational number that's approximately equal to <strong><em>1.6180</em></strong> and just like
it's cousin, <strong><em>Pi</em></strong>, it has a never ending pattern of decimal digits.</p>

<p>\[\Phi = 1.6180339887... \]</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio">article</a>
in Wikipedia, back in the Twentieth Century, architects and artists had
proportioned their works to approximate the Golden Ratio in the form of
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rectangle">Golden Rectangle</a>,
that is believed to be aesthetically pleasing.</p>

<h2>Time for some Calculus!</h2>

<p>This is the equation used to find the <strong><em>n<sup>th</sup></em></strong> Fibonacci Number:</p>

<p>\[ F(n) = {log(\Phi)^n \over \sqrt{5}} \]</p>

<p>Now, let's modify this formula to find the smallest integer i.e. the
first term of the 1000 digit number that fulfills this inequality:</p>

<p>\[ {log(\Phi)^n \over \sqrt{5}} \gt {10^{999}} \]</p>

<p>Expand the formula a little bit more:</p>

<p>\[ n \times log(\Phi) - {log(5) \over 2} \gt {999 \times log(10)} \]</p>

<p>\[ n \times log(\Phi) \gt {999 \times log(10)} + {log(5) \over 2} \]</p>

<p>We need to find n, so let's isolate it:</p>

<p>\[ n = {{999 \times log(10) + {log(5) \over 2}} \over
{log(\Phi)}} = 4782.06 \]</p>

<p>\[ n \cong 4782 \]</p>

<p>So, the first term that contains the 1000 digit Fibonacci Number is
<strong><em>4782</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Here's the solution using Python that solved in 0.000194 seconds:</p>

<div class="codehilite">
<pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">math</span>

<span class="n">limit</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">999</span>
<span class="n">golden_ratio</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">1.6180</span>

<span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">round</span><span class="p">(((</span><span class="n">limit</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">math</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">math</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">math</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">golden_ratio</span><span class="p">)))</span>

<span class="nb">print</span> <span class="n">n</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>So, this is how it would look in our first equation above:</p>

<p>\[F(4782) = {log(\Phi)^{4782} \over \sqrt{5}} = Some Large
Number \]</p>

<p>Well, if you try to find the number using a calculator or compile it on
your computer, you'll end up having a compile error that says <strong><em>"Math
Error"</em></strong>!</p>

<p>Life is full of surprises, isn't it?</p>

<p>We can't state what could possibly happen in the future based on the
present events. It's like a pattern but except you don't know what it
would turn to be in the end.</p>

<p>This is what the Cambridge Mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway">John H.
Conway</a> must have
thought about when he invented the <strong>Game of Life</strong>, who was really
interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">Cellular
Automaton</a>, a field of
mathematical research, that is often used in the earlier days to
simulate systems in real world scenario.</p>

<p>His work was influenced by Hungarian-American Mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann">John von
Neumann</a>, who aimed to
build a machine that had the ability to self-replicate itself and thus,
Conway became successful when he was able to simplify Neumann's ideas
using a mathematical model that he had discovered.</p>

<p>I'd like to share a quote that I found really inspiring:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"You know, people think mathematics is complicated. Mathematics is the
  simple bit. Its the stuff we can understand. Its cats that are
  complicated. I mean, what is it in those little molecules and stuff
  that make one cat behave differently than another, or that make a cat?
  And how do you define a cat? I have no idea." - John H. Conway</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What is Game of Life?</h2>

<p>It's a zero-player game on a two-dimensional grid of squares that has no
winners or losers except a certain set of simple mathematical rules that
achieves an unpredictable behavior of whether a pattern (or population)
will die, become stable or grow out of control.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Wikipedia</a> article, these are the following rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused
by underpopulation.</li>
<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next
generation.</li>
<li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by
overpopulation.</li>
<li>Any dead cell with exactly three neighbours becomes a live cell, as
if by reproduction.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is one of the simplest examples of a <strong><em>self-organizing</em></strong> system. I
find it really interesting as how unique yet different patterns emerge
from a simple set of rules and might be considered as a form of
<strong><em>mathematical beauty</em></strong>. However, did this help mathematicians or
scientists to understand the diversity of life that has evolved on
earth? Perhaps, but I do believe that <strong><em>Mother Nature</em></strong> is far more
complicated than that. However, it did help me realize that I have to
study and understand different patterns and behaviours in order to build
complex systems.</p>

<p>Studying the behavior of cells or animals using a simple set of rules
can help understand how things really work and this influences
scientists and engineers to come up with brilliant solutions to solve
existing problems in this world.</p>

<p>For example, studying the intelligent behavior of ants being able to
build complex ant colonies, trying to understand the cause of traffic
congestions and how to prevent them (which I will be talking about in
another post), finding the cure for cancer and many other human diseases
and so on.</p>

<p>Well, the point that I'm trying to make is, perhaps, the solution to all
of today's current problems could be hidden inside the patterns of this
simple game.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoyed reading this article!</p>

<p>Adios Amigo!</p>

		<p class="description">I implemented a design pattern that could help my team edit content on-the-fly instead of having to navigate through a sea of web pages in a separate portal.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="article-body">
		<p>Two weeks ago, I was thinking of making an improvement on my <a href="https://www.kit.ae">company
website</a>'s custom-built Content Management System
(CMS) in order to make it easier for my team to edit and push content
with ease.</p>

<p>As a matter of coincidence, I came across a book named <a href="http://www.designinginterfaces.com">Designing
Interfaces: Patterns for Effective Interaction
Design</a> by Jennifer Tidwell, which
contains several User Interface and Interaction Design patterns that
inspired me to implement one of the patterns that I had discovered in
the book, <strong><em>"Edit-in-Place"</em></strong>.</p>

<h2>What's Edit-in-Place?</h2>

<p>It's like a tiny WYSIWYG text-editor that allows users to change the
text directly on top of the original text instead of going through a
separate portal or dialog box.</p>

<h2>Why did I build it?</h2>

<p>The fact that my team has to navigate through a sea of pages in the CMS
to edit content is annoying and sometimes, it could be just opening a
lot of new tabs on the browser. Hence, a feature like this would allow
them to edit content <strong><em>"on-the-fly"</em></strong> with zero navigation.</p>

<p>Below, I have made an implementation of it using Javascript and an
experimental design for my blog.</p>

<p><strong>How to use Edit-in-Place:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Hover on top of any text element.</li>
<li>Double-click on the selected element.</li>
<li>Click <strong><em>Save</em></strong> to save changes.</li>
<li>Click <strong><em>Cancel</em></strong> to cancel changes.</li>
</ul>

<figure>
    <iframe width="500" height="1993" src="/static/projects/edit-in-place">
    </iframe>
</figure>

<p>The book claims that <strong><em>Flickr</em></strong> is one of them who implemented this
feature, you can find this feature in most modern Content Management
Systems like Wordpress, Joomla or Drupal or a better example, you have
used this feature while renaming a file on your computer.</p>

<p>However, there are some limits to this i.e. you can only apply this
feature on dynamic webpages as you'll have to write a few additional
lines of <strong><em>AJAX</em></strong> that sends a <strong><em>POST</em></strong> request to your server to
reflect the saved changes on your database.</p>

<p>Hope you guys found this article useful!</p>

		<p class="description">Last week, I built a small tool that converts IIS web.config to Apache .htaccess using Javascript</p>
	</div>
	<div class="article-body">
		<p>Last week, I was migrating my company's website from our in-house IIS
Virtual Private Server to a Dedicated Apache Server in order to improve
the website's overall performance and handle more traffic efficiently.
For those of you who have hosted a website using Microsoft's IIS
Manager, you'll know that it makes use of an XML document named
<strong><em>web.config</em></strong> file, whereas in an Apache Server, it's an <strong><em>.htaccess</em></strong>
file, which is also used to store rules to write clean and friendly
URLs.</p>

<p>Converting from <strong><em>.htaccess</em></strong> to <strong><em>web.config</em></strong> is easy as it's a matter
of importing the rules directly on IIS Manager's <strong><em>URL Rewrite</em></strong> module
but doing the other way around was also possible but only if you did it
manually and I really don't want to waste time on such mundane tasks.</p>

<h2>How did I convert it?</h2>

<p>A little bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">Regular
Expressions</a>, a dash
of Javascript and an understanding on how Apache's <strong><em>mod_rewrite</em></strong>
works, I decided to build a tool that converts <strong><em>web.config</em></strong> to
<strong><em>.htaccess</em></strong> format.</p>

<p><strong>How to use this converter:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Paste your <strong><em>web.config</em></strong> XML code on the textfield</li>
<li>Hit <strong><em>"Convert"</em></strong> to convert to <strong><em>.htaccess</em></strong> format</li>
<li>Please use a valid XML format before converting your code</li>
