		<p class="description">An essay on why I switched from Windows 10 to Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="article-body">
		<p>Ah, it's been a long time since I had posted anything on my blog. In
today's article, I will be talking about my switch from Windows 10 to
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.</p>

<h2>Why did I make the switch?</h2>

<p>I grew up using different versions of Windows OS and my favorite one is
Windows 7. I use Windows 8.1 at work and macOS High Sierra on my
mid-2010 MacBook Pro at home.</p>

<p>Recently, I bought myself a Dell XPS 9360 for serious development. Below
are the specs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intel Core i7 @ 2.4Ghz 7th Generation</li>
<li>256GB SSD</li>
<li>8GB RAM</li>
<li>13.3" Inch Full-HD Display</li>
</ul>

<p>However, I did have an issue with it, it came pre-installed with a bloated Windows 10.</p>

<p>I tried giving Windows 10 a shot even after reading several blog posts
on how Microsoft collects data, forces updates that users can't opt out
of and so on.</p>

<p>Then one fine day, I left my laptop to download some files and then
Windows decides to update without asking for my permission. My download
got disrupted and I finally decided to make the switch.</p>

<p>Besides that, I wanted to have a good environment that's secure,
programmer friendly and wanted to use the Terminal, which is a
programmer's sweet spot for automation, executing scripts and accessing
remote machines and so on.</p>

<h2>Choosing a Linux distribution</h2>

<p>At first, I wanted to try out Arch Linux for it's strong community and
amazing configurations but I thought of taking a safe side by trying out
Ubuntu.</p>

<p>I downloaded the latest distribution from the official website and
created a bootable USB drive. Later, I changed my laptop's BIOS
configuration to Legacy mode from it's UEFI Secure Boot mode, which was
a bit annoying.</p>

<p>After everything was done, I plugged in the bootable USB drive and
voila, Ubuntu's loaded on my screen.</p>

<h2>Check for Hardware Compatibility</h2>

<p>If you've read some articles, you might find some people writing out
comments that when you install Linux on your computer, you might face
some hardware compatibility issues. You can be detect it beforehand by
trying it out on a bootable USB drive.</p>

<p>Luckily, thanks to Dell's hardware support for Linux, it detected all of
my laptop's hardware without any issues.</p>

<p>I decided to go with a minimal installation as I don't want to have any
bloatware on my computer.</p>

<h2>Hello Ubuntu!</h2>

<p>Ubuntu's new user interface looks really clean and minimal and it looked
really vibrant in my laptop's Full HD Display.</p>

<p>The boot time was fast and it took a mere few seconds to display the
login screen. As soon as I logged in, I installed the necessary
development tools such as gcc, python, perl, git, node.js, npm package
manager, Emacs text editor and more.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Well, every operating system has it's own pros and cons, likewise, Linux
has a few cons such as that I won't be able to use Adobe applications
like Photoshop and Illustrator but that's not a big deal for me as my
focus is purely on development.</p>

<p>If you're a programmer and serious about development, I would strongly
recommend you to try it out and you'll never want to return back to
Windows again.</p>

<p>Hope you liked reading this article!</p>

<p>Adios Amigo!</p>

		<p class="description">An introduction into the foundations of Artificial Intelligence.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="article-body">
		<p>It's something that I had in my mind for a long time but never got the
time to execute it but finally, I decided to get out of my comfort zone
to learn new concepts and techniques that would enable me to solve new
problems. Hence, I chose to study <strong><em>Artificial Intelligence</em></strong>.</p>

        Artificial Intelligence, A Modern Approach (3rd Edition)
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I did some online research and found out a really good book named
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Modern-Approach-3rd/dp/0136042597">Artificial Intelligence, A Modern Approach (3rd
Edition)</a> by
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_J._Russell">Stuart Russell</a>
and one of my favorite computer scientists, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norvig">Peter
Norvig</a> (Director of
Research at Google) to learn about it's concepts and techniques. The
book has 1000+ pages and it's a book used for undergraduate and graduate
level courses in university.</p>

<p>My current knowledge of Artificial Intelligence is pretty basic (e.g:
write game AI) and I want to learn more about it and be able absorb any
information related to it and build toy AI projects.</p>

<p>I've completed the first chapter of the book, so let's dive in because
this going to be a long read.</p>

<h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>

<p>We read about it in the news, it's being deployed in our mobile
applications that we use everyday such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter,
Reddit and so on to filter out graphic content, fake information and
insensitive political content. It's also being used in games such as
chess, scientific research, diagnosis of several diseases and
self-driving cars.</p>

<p>But do we know what is it? According to Google Search, it means:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks
  normally requiring human intelligence such as visual perception,
  speech recognition, decision-making and translation between
  languages. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It encompasses a huge number of fields and sub-fields and AI is already
the next big thing that it's shaping our everyday life.</p>

<h2>Approaches towards AI</h2>

<p>The book states that there are four types of approaches when it comes to
creating an AI:</p>

<h3>Acting Humanly</h3>

<p>Proposed by British computer scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan
Turing</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Turing
Test</a> approach was designed
to provide a functional definition of Artificial Intelligence. The test
is proved positive only when a human is unable to tell the difference
between the results of a computer or a human. In order to think like a
human, it should possess the following capabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Natural Language Processing</em></strong> to enable communication in any
language with the human</li>
<li><strong><em>Knowledge Representation</em></strong> to store what it knows or hears</li>
<li><strong><em>Automated Reasoning</em></strong> to make conclusions based on the repository
of information to answer questions</li>
<li><strong><em>Machine Learning</em></strong> to learn and adapt to new patterns and
extrapolations</li>
</ul>

<p>It is to be noted that the test deliberately avoided interaction with
the human because physical interaction with the human wasn't necessary
for intelligence.</p>

<p>Then came another test called <strong><em>Total Turing Test</em></strong>, this was made to
test the computer's ability of visual perception. The computer passes
this test when it's possess the following abilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Computer Vision</em></strong> to be able to perceive and identify objects</li>
<li><strong><em>Robotics</em></strong> to be able to manipulate physical objects</li>
</ul>

</figure>

<p>The abilities mentioned above, composes most of what modern AI is today
and Turing deserves a huge credit for designing this test that still
remains relevant for more than 60+ years.</p>

<h3>Thinking Humanly</h3>

<p>Do we know how humans think? Maybe, but for us to be able to determine
that, we would need to achieve a deep understanding of the human mind
works. There are a few ways such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Introspection</em></strong> by catching our own thoughts as they pass by</li>
<li><strong><em>Psychological experiments</em></strong> by observing the actions or behavior
of a human</li>
<li><strong><em>Brain imaging</em></strong> by observing the brain in action</li>
</ul>

    <figcaption>
        Fields that contributed to the birth of cognitive science.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Once we have sufficient information, it's possible to theorize that a
computer program behaves like a human. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science">Cognitive
Science</a> enables you to
combine both computational models of an AI and psychological
experimentation techniques to provide testable theories as to how the
human mind works.</p>

<h3>Thinking Rationally</h3>

<p>Greek Philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle">Aristotle</a>
attempted to arrange information based on irrefutable evidence based on
the process of reasoning. His rules of inference a.k.a <strong><em>syllogisms</em></strong> (a
form of reasoning in which conclusions are drawn from various
propositions or a set of premises) provided patterns that yielded
correct conclusions from correct premises. For example: <em>"Socrates is a
man; All men are mortal; therefore, Socrates is a mortal being"</em>. These
laws of thought initiated the study of logic, which gave hope to 19th
century logicians to help create intelligent systems.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Aristotle_Altemps_Inv8575.jpg/448px-Aristotle_Altemps_Inv8575.jpg"/>
    <figcaption>

    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>However, there are two main obstacles to this logical approach. Firstly,
it's difficult to convert informal information into formal terms
required by logical notations especially when the information isn't 100%
certain. Secondly, being able to solve a problem in theory vs. solving a
problem in practice are two different things. You can have a computer
that can solve a problem with a few hundred facts yet use up all of it's
resources.</p>

<h3>Acting Rationally</h3>

<p>This is focused on creating <strong><em>intelligent agents</em></strong> that can perform
various tasks like being able to operate autonomously, perceive objects,
adapt to change, create new goals and pursue them. A <strong><em>rational
agent</em></strong> is an agent that acts to achieve the best expected outcome.</p>

<p>Making the right conclusions based on evidences i.e. <strong><em>correct
inferences</em></strong> is part of a rational agent because to act rationally, an
agent must be able to reason with logic to reach to a conclusion for a
given action to achieve one's goals.</p>

<p>However, it doesn't necessarily that it's always "correct", sometimes,
it has there's no such thing as the "right" thing to do but something
must be done.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/IntelligentAgent-SimpleReflex.png"/>
    <figcaption>
        A simple agent reflex.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The skills needed for a Turing Test allows an agent to act rationally
especially on making good decisions using <strong><em>Knowledge
Representation</em></strong> and <strong><em>Automated Reasoning</em></strong>, generating intelligible
sentences using <strong><em>Natural Language Processing</em></strong> for a complex society,
adapting to change and generating effective behavior using <strong><em>Machine
Learning</em></strong>.</p>

<p>But, there are some advantages to this approach. Firstly, it's more
general in terms of the logical approach (mentioned in <strong><em>Thinking
Rationally</em></strong>). Secondly, it's more open to scientific development
compared to human behavior (mentioned in <strong><em>Acting Humanly</em></strong>) and human
thought (mentioned in <strong><em>Thinking Humanly</em></strong>). The standard rationality of
an agent is purely mathematically defined and completely general whereas
human behavior adapts to a specific environment.</p>

<p>Later, the book states that it's focus is going to be based on the
general principles of rational agents and on components for constructing
them.</p>

<h2>Is AI a science, or is it engineering?</h2>

<p>As I was reading the book, it was fascinating to see how various
disciplines have contributed ideas, techniques and viewpoints to the
field of Artificial Intelligence. The following disciplines are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Philosophy</li>
<li>Neuroscience</li>
<li>Mathematics</li>
<li>Economics</li>
<li>Linguistics</li>
<li>Psychology</li>
<li>Computer engineering</li>
<li>Control theory and cybernetics</li>
</ul>

<p>Each disciplines had thoughtful questions like How does a human brain
work? How are valid conclusions drawn from formal rules? How can we
build an efficient computer? How to think and communicate in one's
language? How does the brain process large amounts of information? How
do humans and other living things think and act? How does language
relate to thought?</p>

<p>This part of the book is really long but it was a good way to understand
about it's early foundations.</p>

<h2>How is it useful today?</h2>

<p>Well, that's not very easy to answer because it's being used in multiple
fields and sub-fields. There are so many applications such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Self Driving Cars</li>
<li>Speech Recognition</li>
<li>Facial Recognition</li>
<li>Fighting Malware and Spam bots</li>
<li>Filtering graphic content and fake information from social media</li>
<li>Game playing AIs for different board games like Checkers, Go and Chess</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this used to be science fiction but thanks to the advancements of
Mathematics, Science and Engineering, it's become a reality in today's
era.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Well, I don't know if this is one of the longest articles I have ever
written but I really did enjoy writing this because this made me read
the chapter again and gained a better understanding of the concepts.</p>

<p>I will be writing more articles about it, write algorithms and build
toy  implementations of Artificial Intelligence applications.</p>

<p>In fact, I wrote this article to answer all, if not, most of the
questions from the exercises section of this chapter.</p>

<p>Hope you liked reading this article!</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more!</p>

<p>Before you read more about this article, play with the above game. You
can move the tiles around using your <kbd>&uarr;</kbd><kbd>&larr;</kbd><kbd>&darr;</kbd><kbd>&rarr;</kbd>
or <kbd>W</kbd><kbd>A</kbd><kbd>S</kbd><kbd>D</kbd> keys. The rule is simple, when two tiles with the same
number touch, they merge into one tile. Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key to restart
the game.</p>

<p>Please make sure that you have JavaScript enabled and running in your
browser, otherwise you won't be able to play this game. Oh, just a
little heads up, it might get a little buggy and freeze your browser
window, so keep calm and play patiently.</p>

<p>As for the source code, you can view it in my <a href="https://www.github.com/megacolorboy">GitHub
repository</a> or can be found near
the end of this article.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I was always fond of puzzle games and <strong>2048</strong> is one of them. The first
time I got to play this game was back in 2014 and I would play it on my
iPhone during my train commute to university.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I thought of building a clone and turns out it wasn't as hard
as I had expected it to be, in fact, I was able to build a functional
version in just 15 minutes.</p>

<h2>What are the game mechanics?</h2>

<p>The sliding-puzzle game is played on a <strong>four-by-four</strong> grid with
numbered tiles that is moved by the player in all four directions.</p>

<p>In every move, a new tile would randomly appear in an empty spot in the
grid with a value that consists of <strong>2</strong> or <strong>4</strong>. These tiles are moved
towards any direction as far as it could and if there are two tiles that
collide with the same value, they merge into one tile and as a result,
the score is updated.</p>

<p>The player wins the game once the tile of <strong>2048</strong> appears on the grid,
thus is the name of the game.</p>

<h2>Source code</h2>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/MegaColorBoy/fcce2a2029a1b0352884cbbc1f059cb1.js"></script>

<p>Well then, that's all for the game. Just like the previous ones, I had
fun building this sliding-puzzle game. I'm looking forward to building
more puzzle games and talking about them in my blog.</p>

<p>Hope you guys liked reading this article and have fun playing the game
as many times as you like!</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more!</p>

		<p class="description">Writing out my thoughts on eradicating traffic congestion in highly populated cities.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="article-body">
		<p>Whether it's being implemented or not, I have been thinking on how we
could use <strong><em>Computer Vision</em></strong> to solve traffic congestion.</p>

<p>Since, I live in the <strong><em>United Arab Emirates</em></strong>, I have always observed
that people who commute from <strong><em>Sharjah</em></strong> to <strong><em>Dubai</em></strong> and vice-versa
face a lot of traffic jams despite all the new roads and toll-gates
(yes, I don't seem to understand how does that solve the problem).</p>

    <figcaption>
        Traffic in Al Ittihad Highway.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Well, the problem is not only faced in this country but many countries
such as China, Indonesia and so on.</p>

<h2>What are the causes of traffic congestion?</h2>

<p>Anyways, I jotted down some facts to consider what causes traffic
congestion in the first place:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tail-gating</li>
<li>Inconsistent travel speeds</li>
<li>Uneven vehicular distances</li>
<li>Spontaneous accidents and road rages</li>
<li>Changing from one lane to another</li>
<li>Increase in car population</li>
<li>Peak hours i.e. people going to work and leaving from work</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sure that there could be more but these are the facts that I can
come up with for now.</p>

<h2>How can Computer Vision solve this problem?</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision">Computer Vision</a> is a
field that intersects with multiple areas of technologies in which it
aims to develop an understanding of objects by extracting information
from various digital media sources like images and videos and automate
those tasks that a normal human would do in their daily lives.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://www.onlinebooksreview.com/uploads/blog_images/2018/04/16_computer_vision.jpg"/>
    <figcaption>
        Visualization of Computer Vision.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are various types of problems that Computer Vision algorithms are
able to solve but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Object Recognition or Object Classification</li>
<li>Identification of Objects</li>
<li>Object Detection</li>
<li>Analysis of Motion</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, it's not only about implementing these <strong><em>CNN</em></strong>-based
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">Convolutional Neural
Network</a>)
algorithms but you also need hardware to be able to compute and process
data. </p>

<h2>How would this work?</h2>

<p>There are two scenarios that I had thought while writing this article
and I hope that I'm able to translate my thoughts into accurate
examples.</p>

<p>Let's pretend we have four car drivers: Alex, Bob, Charlie and Dylan.</p>

<h3>Speed-Distance equilibrium</h3>

<p>Alex, Bob and Charlie are driving on the same lane. Alex hits the brake
slowly to shift to another lane, the sensors of Bob's car detects a
change in speed in Alex's car, Bob's car adjusts it's speed to match
Alex's current speed based on the variables of distance and travel time,
Charlie's car adapts the changes of Bob's car and thus, it's a chain
reaction.</p>

<h3>Shifting from one lane to another</h3>

<p>Alex is driving in Lane A and Dylan is driving in Lane B. Alex wants to
shift to Lane B, so he switches on the indicator and Dylan's car sensors
identify that Alex's car wants to change lanes. So Dylan's car slows
down and Alex is able to shift lanes with ease. I thought of it to be
some sort of a <strong><em>"elastic"</em></strong> effect when this occurs.</p>

<p>Well, you might argue that some cars have a system called <strong><em>"Cruise
Control"</em></strong> but here's the part that I'm trying to pitch, as I had
mentioned above, I just wanted to integrate sensors to the front and
rear sides of a vehicle, which means that these sensors can be
integrated in almost any vehicle.</p>

<h2>How is this going to be helpful?</h2>

<p>For starters, traffic congestion will gradually reduce, if not, be
eliminated but there are other beneficial factors to it, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Less fuel consumption</li>
<li>Less time is required to reach a destination</li>
<li>No tail-gating</li>
<li>Could prevent major road accidents</li>
</ul>

<p>However, if the sensors fail to work, the car driver will still be safe
because it's surrounded by other cars that have the sensors. This made
me think of another question, does that mean do all cars require sensors
or only a few? I find it quite intriguing.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Although, these sensors might require a vehicle to have some intelligent
capabilities, it may not require the type of network found in an
autonomous vehicle.</p>

<p>The idea of placing sensors in the front and rear of a vehicle can
optimize the flow of traffic and thus, it might help eliminate traffic
congestion.</p>

		<p class="description">Basically, a minimal blog engine with a paper-like user interface with better enhancements.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="article-body">
		<div class="post-notification">
    <h3>Blog engine updated!</h3>
    <p>As of March 1st 2019, I have changed my blog engine from a dynamic website to a custom-built static site generator. <a href="../writings/posts/say-hello-new-blog/">Read more &rarr;</a></p>
</div>

<p>Whenever I'm writing a new blog post, I would write it using HTML on my
text editor i.e. using <strong><em>Sublime Text</em></strong> and copy-paste the source code
into my blog engine and hit "Submit" and that was really annoying.</p>

<p>You might be thinking to yourself as to why I'm putting myself through
such a tedious process to write a blog article when there are several
<strong><em>WYSIWYG</em></strong> text editor plugins.</p>

<p>Truth is, I have to admit that I was lazy and I cared a lot about
writing my blog articles but never cared about the tool I had built that
to write my blog articles, so I decided to upgrade it and make it even
better than what it was previously!</p>

<h2>Why rewrite it?</h2>

<p>For starters, the old one had a clunky and pretty much boring user
interface. I used <strong><em>CKEditor</em></strong> text editor plugin but to be honest, I
rarely used any of it's features as I was just directly copy-pasting my
source code from Sublime Text to the text field box.</p>

<p>Over time, it became slow due to spaghetti code and it required a lot of
code refactoring as I wrote this code during my earlier days of
programming by following various programming tutorials.</p>

<p>Here's some screenshots of the old blog engine:</p>

</figure>

<figure>
    <img src="/static/images/be-v1-3.png" />
    <figcaption>
    Fig.3: Edit page
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And, last but not the least, it didn't make me feel like I was writing a
blog but rather felt like writing HTML code in a more tedious manner.</p>

<h2>Time for a change!</h2>

<p>For the past two weeks, I have been working on a new version of the blog
engine and I had decided to give it some new features like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clean and paper-like user interface by taking inspiration from Google's Material Theming Design guidelines</li>
<li>Minimal text editor built from scratch that can be extensible in the future</li>
<li>Auto-save article every minute</li>
<li>Emojis, LaTeX syntax, JavaScript files and IFRAME windows</li>
<li>Live search bar to filter articles by keywords or categories</li>
</ul>

<p>In case, you're wondering, I built this using vanilla JavaScript and a
custom-built MVC PHP framework with a MySQL database.</p>

<p>Here's some screenshots of the new blog engine:</p>

</figure>

<p>What I really wanted to achieve with the new blog engine is that I want
to give myself an enjoyable writing experience besides, this blog post
was written from the new blog engine.</p>

<p>Well, it's stable as of yet but I need to run a few tests and build more
functionalities before deploying it on my production server and finally
saying good-bye to the old version.</p>

		<p class="description">Can seeing things from another's perspective create empathy and help solve technical challenges?</p>
	</div>
	<div class="article-body">
		<p>Recently, I've started reading this book named <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/designing-for-emotion">Designing For
Emotion</a> by
<a href="http://aarronwalter.com/">Aarron Walter</a> and I've made it a point to
read it during my free time and so far I have completed three chapters
of the book.</p>

<p>In the first chapter of the book, I found a really interesting sentence,
written by the author:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Keep in mind that ignoring human needs is not a history we are doomed
  to repeat. Through our designs, we can see and connect with other
  human beings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you think a good software builds strong connections with other human
beings? Well, we have good examples like Facebook, Google, Netflix, and
Microsoft are proof that they have a massive pool of audience who likes
to use their products on a daily basis.</p>

<p>In this article, I will share some of my thoughts on how empathy can be
used to build and design powerful applications.</p>

<h2>User Interface Matters</h2>

<p>To any user, whatever is displayed on the application matters the most,
in this case, it's the <strong><em>User Interface</em></strong> of an application. If it
doesn't allow a user to perform their desired task, it will end up in
their Recycle Bin.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://cdn.cultofmac.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Ping-780x604.jpg"/>
    <figcaption>
        Fig. 1: Apple's Ping
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are many examples in the book and one of the examples is about
<strong><em>Apple's Ping</em></strong> (refer to Fig. 1), which was an attempt in creating a
social network on <strong><em>iTunes</em></strong> but it turned out to be unsuccessful as
users learned that they weren't able to share songs on Facebook or
Twitter and it lacked basic features. As a result, users didn't come
back to it again.</p>

<p>In my opinion, a good user interface should be relatively easy to use
and be more reliable in terms of pagespeed or simple and easy navigation
for the user. I mean, think about it, if your user is able to complete
their desired task and that puts a smile on their face, the user will
share their experiences to their friends and you'll get more people to
use your application, thus making your application more powerful.</p>

<h2>A Universal Design</h2>

<p>A door knob comes with multiple designs such as rotating knobs and
levers but what matters the most to the people? The design or the
functionality? I personally prefer a lever knob over a rotating knob as
I find it quite annoying. Weird analogy but the point is, it should just
open the door, nothing fancy.</p>

<p>Similarly, when we build our software, by following proper techniques,
we can choose to make it beautiful but also choose to make it accessible
and functional for everybody, at all costs.</p>

<h2>Listen to your users</h2>

<p>When building and designing a piece of code, it should and always be for
the people that uses or will use your product. By understanding what's
important to the users, it can help you get to the core of the problem
and surpass technical challenges easily.</p>

<p>This can be achieved by gathering user requirements in the form of
surveys, user feedback and A/B testing. Remember, software is just an
expressive form of bringing your ideas to life and writing code is
building on top of the idea to achieve a certain goal but empathy is the
secret sauce to the success of your application.</p>

<h2>UX is not UI</h2>

<p>What's the first thing that comes to your mind when a friend of yours
tells you: <em>"Hey, I'm working as a UX Designer at UberCoolCorp!"</em>? Does
he build User Interfaces? Is he a Visual Graphics Designer? Neither,
actually!</p>

<p>User Experience is not about how your application looks but how it feels
and makes it simple and easier to interact with your users. I'd like to
share an interesting quote from Usabilla's UX Expert, Erik Flowers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>UX is the intangible design of a strategy that brings us to a
  solution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>User Experience encompasses a lot of elements such as Information
Architecture, Interaction Design, Usability, Product Design and so on.
Below is a picture for your reference about why User Experience is not
User Interface:</p>

    <img src="http://www.uxisnotui.com/downloads/with-title.png"/>
    <figcaption>
        Fig. 2: How UX wants to be seen.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Although, it does have a lot of elements, UI is a huge part of the
design process because strong visual aesthetics are still essential in
UX, which is also one of the aspects of your user's interactions with
the application.</p>

<h2>Progressive Enhancement</h2>

<p>A strategy that is known to take you on journey from simplicity to
complexity. It's about starting off with a strong, practical foundation
and then building on top of it. It's easier to maintain and make small
yet incremental changes, renders the application to be more robust and
it works for all users.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Well, I'm sure there a lot of elements to this topic but I thought of
highlighting some of the most important parts of building and designing
software with empathy. As engineers or developers, it is our job to
ensure that our final product is usable and accessible to our end-user.</p>

		<p class="description">How to generate the next permutation of any given sequence in lexicographical order.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="article-body">
		<p>According to <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=24">Problem 24</a> in Project Euler, you are asked to find the millionth permutation using the following sequence of 10 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). Well, if you do the math, there are around <strong><em>10! = 3,628,800 unique permutations</em></strong> and that means, you have to come up with an efficient algorithm.</p>

<p>I tried writing a recursive function but it turned out to be a bit tricky, so I thought of writing a brute-force solution which seemed far more simpler to understand and it's quite efficient.</p>

<h2>Algorithm Description</h2>

<p>The following algorithm is quite simple and easy to understand:</p>

<div class="codehilite">
<pre><span></span><code>1. Find i such that a[i-1] is greater than or equal to a[i].
2. Find j such that a[j-1] is less than or equal to a[i-1].
3. Swap a[i] with a[j].
4. Reverse the suffix from a[i+1] to the last element.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Suppose, if the first step fails, it means the current permutation is the last one because such an index that does not exist. However, it's simple to implement the following algorithm correctly and efficiently, so let's take a look at the implementation.</p>

<h2>Python Implementation</h2>

<p>The following method only generates the next permutation of any given sequence, so if you're interested in generating all the permutations, especially, for very large lists, this function can be useful.</p>

<p><strong>Implementation of the method(s):</strong></p>

		<p class="description">Rather than sticking to using a brute force solution, I decided to find the 1000 digit fibonacci number using the Golden Ratio.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="article-body">
		<p>Back in February, I said that I'm going to start <a href="/posts/i-decided-to-learn-python">solving Project Euler
problems using Python</a> and yes, I
have been doing it actively but sometimes, I don't find the time to post
the solutions.</p>

<p>If you're someone who has tried Project Euler before, you'll know that
you'll get to encounter problems that require you to implement smart
solutions to crunch big numbers efficiently. One of those problems is
<a href="https://www.projecteuler.net/problem=25">Problem 25</a>, which states to
find the first term in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci
Sequence</a> that contains
1000 digits.</p>

<p>This problem can be easily solved using a Brute Force solution, instead,
I opted to try out a mathematical solution that makes use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio">Golden
Ratio</a> and also, it gave me
the perfect excuse to try writing those formulas using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a> markup.</p>

<h2>What is Golden Ratio?</h2>

<p>Famously known as <strong><em>Phi</em></strong> that represents the Golden Ratio is an
irrational number that's approximately equal to <strong><em>1.6180</em></strong> and just like
it's cousin, <strong><em>Pi</em></strong>, it has a never ending pattern of decimal digits.</p>

<p>\[\Phi = 1.6180339887... \]</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio">article</a>
in Wikipedia, back in the Twentieth Century, architects and artists had
proportioned their works to approximate the Golden Ratio in the form of
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rectangle">Golden Rectangle</a>,
that is believed to be aesthetically pleasing.</p>

<h2>Time for some Calculus!</h2>

<p>This is the equation used to find the <strong><em>n<sup>th</sup></em></strong> Fibonacci Number:</p>

<p>\[ F(n) = {log(\Phi)^n \over \sqrt{5}} \]</p>

<p>Now, let's modify this formula to find the smallest integer i.e. the
first term of the 1000 digit number that fulfills this inequality:</p>

<p>\[ {log(\Phi)^n \over \sqrt{5}} \gt {10^{999}} \]</p>

<p>Expand the formula a little bit more:</p>

<p>\[ n \times log(\Phi) - {log(5) \over 2} \gt {999 \times log(10)} \]</p>

<p>\[ n \times log(\Phi) \gt {999 \times log(10)} + {log(5) \over 2} \]</p>

<p>We need to find n, so let's isolate it:</p>

<p>\[ n = {{999 \times log(10) + {log(5) \over 2}} \over
{log(\Phi)}} = 4782.06 \]</p>

<p>\[ n \cong 4782 \]</p>

<p>So, the first term that contains the 1000 digit Fibonacci Number is
<strong><em>4782</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Here's the solution using Python that solved in 0.000194 seconds:</p>

<p>So, this is how it would look in our first equation above:</p>

<p>\[F(4782) = {log(\Phi)^{4782} \over \sqrt{5}} = Some Large
Number \]</p>

<p>Well, if you try to find the number using a calculator or compile it on
your computer, you'll end up having a compile error that says <strong><em>"Math
Error"</em></strong>!</p>

<p>Hope you liked reading this article!</p>
