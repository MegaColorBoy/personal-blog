		<p>Yesterday, I decided to try XFCE desktop environment and boy, it's really faster than the GNOME desktop environment.</p>

<p>As soon as I started to play around with it, I noticed a good amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing">screen tearing</a> and to my surprise, I came to know that the XFCE environment is known to have such issues.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of research, I was able to fix it. Here are the steps:</p>

<p><strong>Note: This is done on Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic Beaver</strong></p>

<p>If you dont have the package <code>inxi</code> installed in your system, do it right now:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
sudo apt install inxi
</code>
</pre>

<p>After you're done installing, type the following command to find out which graphics you're using:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
inxi -G
</code>
</pre>

<p>If you're using an Intel Graphics Driver, you'll probably get something like this:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
Graphics:  Card: Intel Device 5926
           Display Server: x11 (X.Org 1.19.6 ) driver: i915 Resolution: 1920x1080@60.00hz
           OpenGL: renderer: Mesa DRI Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 (Kaby Lake GT3e) (KBL GT3)
           version: 4.6 Mesa 20.0.8
</code>
</pre>

<p>You can try go to <strong>Settings Manager->Window Manager Tweaks->Compositor" and enable **Synchronize drawing to the vertical blank</strong>. From <a href="https://techstop.github.io/fix-screen-tearing-xfce/">what I've read</a>, if you do that, it should stop but it didn't do anything for me.</p>

<p>If the above technique didn't work, go to <code>/usr/shar/X11/xorg.conf.d/</code> and create a file for your graphics card named <code>10-intel.conf</code>.</p>

<p>Copy-paste the following configuration into the file:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
Section "Device"
  Identifier  "Intel Graphics"
  Driver      "intel"
  Option "TearFree" "true"
EndSection
</code>
</pre>

<p>Save the file, reboot your system and look for any screen tearing issues. If you didn't face any, that means it worked! &#x1F601;</p>
