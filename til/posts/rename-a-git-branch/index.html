		<p>Using branches are one of the most powerful features of Git and becomes a part of the software development process.</p>

<p>Last night, I came across an issue where I created a new branch and committed my changes until the <code>git</code> tool rejected it because the branch was already created by someone else in the repository.</p>

<p>Luckily, I was able to resolve this issue by renaming my branch using <code>git branch -m</code> command.</p>

<p>Here's a short guide on how you can do that too!</p>

<h2>1. Switch to the remote branch you want to rename</h2>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
git checkout &lt;your_old_branch&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<h2>2. Rename the current remote branch</h2>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
git branch -m &lt;your_new_branch&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<p>Proceed to the next step, if you've pushed your old branch to the remote repository.</p>

<h2>3. Push the renamed remote branch</h2>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
git push origin -u &lt;your_new_branch&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<h2>4. Delete the old remote branch</h2>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
git push origin --delete &lt;your_old_branch&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<p>If you've come this far without any issues, you've successfully renamed your local and remote Git branch.</p>

<p>Hope you found this useful!</p>
