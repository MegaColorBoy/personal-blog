		<p>Today, I wrote a simple method that fetches images from the database via AJAX and also, I defined an empty object as a default parameter:</p>

<pre>
<code class="js">
function fetchImages(obj={}){
    // some code here...
}

fetchImages();
</code>
</pre>

<p>The default <code>obj</code> parameter would contain extra parameters like <code>id</code>, <code>slug</code> and <code>page</code>, which would be then used to fetch a particular group of images, else, it'll fetch a random set of images.</p>

<p>This method worked fine in Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox but not in Internet Explorer. I thought of inspecting the code and I was facing weird errors like <code>undefined</code> or <code>Expected: ')'</code> on the IE console.</p>

<p>Luckily, I had compared it to the other methods that didn't have any default parameters, so I did a little research and turns out that according to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/default_parameters">Mozilla's documentation</a>, default function parameters are proposed by the ES6 syntax and at this point, I realized that Internet Explorer <strong>doesn't support ES6 syntax</strong>. What a bummer! &#x1F612;</p>

<p>However, there's a way to prevent this from happening by rewriting the method like this:</p>

<pre>
<code class="js">
function fetchImages(obj){
    // Check if obj is defined, else make it assign it as an empty object.
    var data = obj || {};

    // some code here...
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>And BAM! The method worked flawlessly just as it's intended to do so. &#x1F60E;</p>

<p>Addtionally, you may refer to the <a href="http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/">ECMAScript 6 Compatibility table</a> that you might find it quite helpful to check browser compatiblity for Internet Explorer versions 11 and under.</p>
