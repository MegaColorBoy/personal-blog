		<p>Finding the difference between two sets i.e. Set A and Set B is basically returning a new set that contains values of Set A that don't exist in Set B or vice-versa.</p>

<p>Here's an example:</p>

<pre>
<code class="js">
var a = [1,2,3,4,5];
var b = [1,1,2,3,4];
</code>
</pre>

<p>I wrote a shorter implementation using JavaScript's <code>.filter()</code> method:</p>

<pre>
<code class="js">
function array_diff(a,b){
    return a.filter(i => b.indexOf(i) === -1);
}    
</code>
</pre>

<p>Once you execute this method, you'll get the following as a result:</p>

<pre>
<code class="js">
var c = array_diff(a,b);
console.log(c) // returns [5]
</code>
</pre>

<h2>BONUS: What does the .filter() method do?</h2>

<p>This method returns a new array with elements that pass the conditions provided by a callback function.</p>

<p>If the conditions aren't passed, you'll receive an empty array.</p>

<p>In this article, <code>(i =&gt; b.indexOf(i) === -1)</code> is considered as the callback function in which the <code>i</code> refers to the index of the current element of array A and is then used as a parameter to check if the element doesn't exist in array B.</p>

<p>The neat thing about this method is that it doesn't mutate on the array that it's being called from.</p>
