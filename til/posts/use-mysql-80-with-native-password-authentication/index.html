		<p>Last month, I was configuring an Ubuntu Server to deploy a client's project that uses MySQL 8.0 and PHP 7.2.
So, I installed the necessary dependencies and finally installed MySQL 8.0, created a new schema and imported the database tables required for the project.</p>

<p>Next, I typed the project URL and ran into this error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unable to load plugin 'caching<em>sha2</em>password'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're running PHP 7.2 and facing this error, you should know that PHP 7.2 doesn't support native password authentication by default. But it's a simple fix, all you have to do is either one of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="#opt1">Alter the current user's authentication to native password</a></li>
<li><a href="#opt2">Create a new user with native password authentication</a></li>
</ol>

<h2><a id="opt1"></a> Alter the current user's authentication to native password</h2>

<pre>
<code class="mysql">
ALTER USER 'your_user'@'your_server_host' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'your_password';
</code>
</pre>

<h2><a id="opt2"></a> Create a new user with native password authentication</h2>

<pre>
<code class="mysql">
CREATE USER 'your_user'@'your_server_host ' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'your_password'
</code>
</pre>

<p>For the changes to take effect, you need to reload the privileges by typing the following:</p>

<pre>
<code class="mysql">
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
</code>
</pre>

<p>Hope this helps you out!</p>
