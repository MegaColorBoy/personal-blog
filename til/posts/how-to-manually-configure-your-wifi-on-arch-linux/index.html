		<p>Recently, I thought of playing around with Arch Linux to learn more about Linux under-the-hood and to see if it can become my new daily driver.</p>

<p>As I booted from live USB, I tried connecting to my WiFi using <code>wifi-menu</code> but it never worked after selecting my network name and entering the credentials.</p>

<p>So, I did a little bit of research in <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org">ArchWiki</a> and forums and I figured a way to set it up manually using <code>netctl</code> by myself.</p>

<p><code>netctl</code> is a network profile manager and it's apparently an Arch Linux project.</p>

<h2>1. Select your interface</h2>

<p>Before you begin to set up your WiFi connection from your computer, check if your network interface is being detected:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
iwconfig
</code>
</pre>

<p>Since it's a WiFi connection, your interface most probably must be <code>wlan0</code>. If you see it, then set the interface up:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
ip link set wlan0 up
</code>
</pre>

<h2>2. Scan for networks</h2>

<p>Now, that your interface, use it to scan for your WiFi network:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
iwlist wlan0 scan | less
</code>
</pre>

<p>Once, you execute this command, you must be able to see your WiFi's SSID (or network name).</p>

<p>Now, put your interface down for a while:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
ip link set wlan0 down
</code>
</pre>

<h2>3. Create a network profile</h2>

<p>Alright, go to <code>/etc/netctl/examples/</code> directory and make a copy of the <code>wireless-wpa</code> file to the <code>/etc/netctl</code> directory:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
cd /etc/netctl/examples
cp /etc/netctl/examples/wireless-wpa /etc/netctl/your-wifi-name
</code>
</pre>

<p>Now, go back to <code>/etc/netctl/</code> directory and open the <code>your-wifi-name</code> file with your preferred text editor and edit the following only:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
ESSID: your-wifi-name
key: your-wifi-password
</code>
</pre>

<p>After you're done editing, save the file.</p>

<h2>4. Test network profile</h2>

<p>To test if your profile is working, do the following:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
netctl start your-wifi-name
ping -c 3 www.google.com
</code>
</pre>

<p>In case, you get an error, try doing this:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
ip link set dev wlan0 down
netctl start your-wifi-name
ping -c 3 www.google.com
</code>
</pre>

<p>If you're able to ping, then it works. Else, edit your network profile and try connecting to it again.</p>

<h2>5. Enable network profile</h2>

<p>If you've reached this stage that means your network profile must be working fine. Just do the following to enable the network profile to run the internet throughout the setup:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
netctl enable your-wifi-name
</code>
</pre>
