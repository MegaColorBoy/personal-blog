<h2>BONUS: Display list of files by extension with file sizes</h2>

<p>Last month, I was trying to free up some space in our company server, so I realized that there were a lot of <em>.zip</em> files taking up a lot of space. So, I wrote a few commands to get me a list of zip files with their file sizes in sorting order into a .txt file:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
find . -iname \*.zip -exec du -sh {} \; &gt; zipfiles.txt
sort -rh zipfiles.txt > newfile.txt
</code>
</pre>

<p>You can .zip with any extension to suit your needs! :)</p>
