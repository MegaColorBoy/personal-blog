		<p>Previously, I used to determine my Public IP address on Google Search by typing <strong><em>"What is my IP?"</em></strong> and I was good with it.</p>

<p>Until, I thought of actually viewing it via the terminal itself. So, I wrote two lines of code in my <code>~/.bashrc</code> file:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">    
export myip="$(dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com)"
alias myip="echo $myip"
</code>
</pre>

<p>Alternatively, you could try this too:</p>

<pre>
<code class='bash'>
export myip="$(dig TXT +short o-o.myaddr.l.google.com @ns1.google.com)"
</code>
</pre>

<p>Save the file and apply your new configuration by typing the following command:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">    
source ~/.bashrc
</code>
</pre>

<p>That's it, now all you have to do is type <code>myip</code> in your terminal and it will display your Public IP address.</p>

<p>Hope you found this useful! &#x1F600;</p>
