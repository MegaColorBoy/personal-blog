		<p>In my current Arch Linux installation, I decided to use a window manager called i3. It's really awesome and it comes with a really lightweight terminal emulator called <strong>urxvt</strong>. It's very minimal and I lked it but when I tried to copy-paste text from one terminal to another, I wasn't able to.</p>

<p>However, thanks to the internet, I did some research and figured a way out.</p>

<h2>1. Install xClip</h2>

<p>First, you need to ensure that you have installed the <code>xclip</code> package, which will be used to copy-paste text in the emulator.</p>

<p>Type the following command to install the package:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
pacman -S xclip
</code>
</pre>

<h2>2. Activate Clipboard using Perl</h2>

<p>Now, you have to paste these custom commands into your <code>clipboard</code> file, which is found in <code>/usr/lib/urxvt/perl</code> directory:</p>

<pre>
<code class="perl">
# paste selection from clipboard
sub paste {
     my ($self) = @_;
     my $content = `/usr/bin/xclip -loop 1 -out -selection clipboard` ;
     $self->tt_write ($content);
}

# copy text to clipbard on selection
sub on_sel_grab {
     my $query = $_[0]->selection;
     open (my $pipe, '| /usr/bin/xclip -in -selection clipboard') or die;
     print $pipe $query;
     close $pipe;
 }
</code>
</pre>

<h2>3. Modify your .Xresources</h2>

<p>Add these keybindings to your <code>.Xresources</code> file:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
URxvt.keysym.Shift-Control-V: perl:clipboard:paste
URxvt.iso14755: False
URxvt.perl-ext-common: default,clipboard
</code>
</pre>

<p>After adding it, refresh your <code>.Xresources</code> settings:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
xrdb -merge .Xresources
</code>
</pre>

<p>Reboot your terminal and try selecting some text from your terminal using your mouse and paste it using <code>Ctrl</code>+<code>Shift</code>+<code>V</code> and it should work! </p>

<p>That's it! Enjoy &#x1F603;</p>
