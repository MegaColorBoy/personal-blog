		<p>This error shows up when two different projects are merged (i.e. they both could be the same project but unaware of each other's existence and have different commit histories).</p>

<p>If you are facing this, chances are that:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You must have cloned a project and the <code>.git</code> directory must have corrupted or got deleted and at this point, Git is unaware of the changes being made and will throw this error when you try to <em>push to</em> or <em>pull from</em> the remote repository.</p></li>
<li><p>You created a new repository, made some changes and added the commits and then you tried to pull from the remote repository.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Well, you can easily resolve by passing the <code>--allow-unrelated-histories</code> flag when pulling the latest updates from the remote repository:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories
</code>
</pre>

<p>Hope you found this useful!</p>
