		<p>You may wonder <strong>"why not install Composer via apt or yum package manager?"</strong> and yes, it can be installed that way too.</p>

<p>But what if you are using old composer packages or you wanted to skip the checks done during the interactive installation routine, this could be the way for you.</p>

<p>I wouldn't really call it an advanced technique or something but if you know what you're doing, then you should be in the right direction.</p>

<p>The below snippet will show you how to install it manually:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
wget "https://getcomposer.org/download/VERSION_X.X.X/composer.phar"
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/composer
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Yes, that's it!</h2>

<p>By placing Composer in the <code>/usr/local/bin</code> directory, it will be accessible from any directory within the system and you can run it globally.</p>

<p>To check if you've installed it correctly, just do the following:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
composer -V
</code>
</pre>

<p>Hope you found this tip useful!</p>
