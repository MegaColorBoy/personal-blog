		<p>Today, I was debugging a piece of code that is supposed to return a list of data based on the year, the funny thing is that the data was being returned on the development server but not on the production one.</p>

<p>Weird, so I opened up <strong>MySQL Workbench</strong> and wrote a simple query to see if the dates were being returned because who knows maybe they weren't stored at all.</p>

<pre>
<code class="mysql">
SELECT YEAR(date_posted) FROM posts;
</code>
</pre>

<p>The values returned were <code>null</code>. Now, that's strange because the dates were present in the column. So, I took a deep look and figured out that the dates were stored in <code>VARCHAR</code> instead of <code>DATETIME</code> data type! &#x1F614;</p>

<p>Luckily, I figured that there's a way to resolve this by <code>STR_TO_DATE()</code> function:</p>

<pre>
<code class="mysql">
SELECT YEAR(STR_TO_DATE(date_posted, '%Y-%m-%d')) FROM posts;
</code>
</pre>

<p>Bam! The results were coming now! &#x1F60C;</p>

<p>Hope this helps you out!</p>
