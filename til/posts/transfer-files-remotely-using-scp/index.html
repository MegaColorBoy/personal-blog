		<p>Do you want to transfer files remotely from one UNIX-based system to another? Try using the <code>scp</code> tool, which is a shorthand for <strong>Secure Copy Protocol</strong>. It's based off the SSH protocol using it as a means to securely transfer files from a local machine to one or more remote machines.</p>

<p>Here's a code snippet that can help you out to transfer from computer A to computer B:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
scp your_local_file user@ipaddress:/directory_to_store
</code>
</pre>

<p>And transfer from computer B to computer A:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
scp user@ipaddress:/directory/file_name your_local_directory
</code>
</pre>

<p>Oh, before you transfer files to another computer, make sure that you have permissions to access it first. If you don't have one, then create a new account using <code>useradd</code> on your remote system.</p>
