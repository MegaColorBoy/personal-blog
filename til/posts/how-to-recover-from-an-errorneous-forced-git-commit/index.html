		<p>If you're the type of person who types <code>git push -f origin master</code>, please don't do that as it might overwrite your entire branch. I'm saying this because I did this once and I thought I lost all the files.</p>

<p>Luckily, I was a bit relieved as <code>git</code> is a VCS (Version Control Software), which means the files are most likely not <strong>deleted</strong>. This is when I came across <code>git reflog</code> command.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reflog">Git manual</a>, this is what it does:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reference logs, or "reflogs", record when the tips of branches and other references were updated in the local repository.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a life-saver especially if you wanted to return back to the previous point in time. Here's how I recovered my files back again:</p>

<ol>
<li>Type <code>git reflog show remotes/origin/master</code></li>
<li>Find and make note of the previous commit hash.</li>
<li>Create a new branch with using the previous commit hash like this: <code>git branch &lt;new_branch_name&gt; &lt;previous_commit_hash&gt;</code></li>
<li>Then finally, push the files to the new branch: <code>git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -m "pushing recovered files" &amp;&amp; git push origin &lt;new_branch_name&gt;</code></li>
<li>Checkout to the newly created branch: <code>git checkout &lt;new_branch_name&gt;</code></li>
<li>Delete the corrupted branch and replace it with the newly created branch that contains your restored files.</li>
</ol>

<p>If I didn't discover this, I don't really know what I would have done to recover those files.</p>
