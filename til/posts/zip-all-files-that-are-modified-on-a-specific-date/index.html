		<p>I wrote a nifty command to make an archive of the files that I have modified on a particular date. By doing so, this script comes in handy during urgent deployments, so that I don't lose track of the files that I should be updating.</p>

<p>Here's the command at your disposal:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
find . -maxdepth 10 -type f -newermt "2021-04-10" | zip -qur archive.zip -@
</code>
</pre>

<h2>How this works?</h2>

<p>Let's see what this command does in pieces:</p>

<p><code>find</code> is the utility tool used to return the filenames that match the specified parameters in the given directory.</p>

<p><code>-maxdepth</code> is the flag that allows you to specify the depth of recursive searches it should perform.</p>

<p><code>-type</code> is the flag that determines if you're looking for file or a directory.</p>

<p><code>-newermt</code> is the flag that determines if the file has been modified on and/or after the given date.</p>

<p>Once, the file has been found, the output is being <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/piping-in-unix-or-linux/">redirected</a> to the <code>zip</code> utility function, which would then add the files to the <code>.zip</code> file.
The <code>-q</code> flag would perform the operation in silent mode, <code>-u</code> flag would update the files in the archive if modified or add it as a new file if it doesn't exist and <code>-@</code> takes the list of files from the standard input.</p>

<p>If you want to ignore certain directories or file extensions, in that case, you can exclude them like so:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
find . -maxdepth 30 -type f ! -path "./path/to/directory/*" !  -path "*.ext" -newermt "2021-04-10" | zip -qur archive.zip -@
</code>
</pre>

<p>Or, you can even archive the modified files by specifying a date range:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
touch --date "2021-04-10" startdate
touch --date "2021-04-15" enddate
find . -maxdepth 30 -type f -newer startdate -not -newer enddate | zip -ur archive.zip -@
</code>
</pre>

<p>Hope you found this tip useful! &#x1F601;</p>
