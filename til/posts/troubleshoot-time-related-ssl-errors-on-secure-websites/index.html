		<p>As I was configuring Arch Linux setup on my old HP 8460p laptop, I noticed that I wasn't able to access any site using Chrome or Firefox as I was faced with a weird error:</p>

<p><img src="../static/til_images/ssl-time-error.png" alt="SSL Certificate Error" /></p>

<p>I was quite confused and thought it might be an issue with my WiFi card or probably some server issue but turns out it was neither of them.</p>

<p>On the side of my screen, I noticed my system time was displaying 4 hours ahead of the current local time, which is wrong. So, I did a little research and turns out my suspicions were correct, it's a time-related issue.</p>

<h2>How is time related to secure websites?</h2>

<p>Well, each website that uses SSL or that begins with <code>https://</code> are only valid for a period of time before getting expired. If the website that you're trying to visit presents a certificate with a time and date that doesn't match with your system's clock, Firefox will prevent you from accessing the page.</p>

<h2>How to fix it?</h2>

<p>Actually, the fix is quite simple. All you have to is just set the correct date and time on your system and you're good to go!</p>

<p>If you're using Linux, just do the following:</p>

<h3>1. Set up your timezone</h3>

<p>You can look up for your timezones by executing the following:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
timedatectl list-timezones | less
</code>
</pre>

<p>Once, you've found your timezone, execute the following by replacing <code>Continent/Country</code> with your timezone:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
timedatectl set-timezone Continent/Country
</code>
</pre>

<h3>2. Manually set your local time</h3>

<p>Execute the following to set up your time, locally on your system:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
timedatectl set-time "yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss"
</code>
</pre>

<h3>3. Set the hardware clock from the system clock</h3>

<p>The following command sets the hardware clock from the system clock:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
hwclock --systohc
</code>
</pre>

<p>Now, that you've executed them, you should be able to view the correct time on your system by executing <code>timedatectl status</code> and you should see something like this:</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
               Local time: Sun 2020-06-14 21:04:04 +04
           Universal time: Sun 2020-06-14 17:04:04 UTC
                 RTC time: Sun 2020-06-14 17:04:05    
                Time zone: Asia/Dubai (+04, +0400)    
System clock synchronized: no                         
              NTP service: inactive 
</code>
</pre>

<p>Although, this issue was time-related, you may face the same kind of error for various other reasons. Try reading more on how to <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-time-errors-secure-websites">troubleshoot</a> errors like these from Mozilla's official documentation.</p>
