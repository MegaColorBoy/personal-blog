					<p class="date">07.11.2020 <span>•</span> 2 minutes read</p>
					
						<p class="desc">Open up your text editor and use the following RegEx pattern to find and remove the duplicate lines:I found this technique on Regular-Expressions.info and I'm going to quote their explanation over here:The caret will match only at the start of a line. So the regex engine will only attempt to match the remainder of the regex there. The dot and star combination simply matches an entire line, whatever its contents, if any. The parentheses store the matched line into the first backreference.Next we will match the line separator. I put the question mark into  to make this regex work with both Windows  and UNIX  text files. So up to this point we matched a line and the following line break.Now we need to check if this combination is followed by a duplicate of that same line. We do this simply with . This is the first backreference which holds the line we matched. The backreference will match that very same text.If the backreference fails to match, the regex match and the backreference are discarded, and the regex engine tries again at the start of the next line. If the backreference succeeds, the plus symbol in the regular expression will try to match additional copies of the line. Finally, the dollar symbol forces the regex engine to check if the text matched by the backreference is a complete line. We already know the text matched by the backreference is preceded by a line break (matched by ).Therefore, we now check if it is also followed by a line break or if it is at the end of the file using the dollar sign.The entire match becomes  (or  etc.). Because we are doing a search and replace, the line, its duplicates, and the line breaks in between them, are all deleted from the file. Since we want to keep the original line, but not the duplicates, we use  as the replacement text to put the original line back in.Hope you found this tip useful!</p>

Switch to the remote branch you want to rename2. Rename the current remote branchProceed to the next step, if you've pushed your old branch to the remote repository.3. Push the renamed remote branch4. Delete the old remote branchIf you've come this far without any issues, you've successfully renamed your local and remote Git branch.Hope you found this useful!</p>

In this example, we'll add some colors to a bunch of  elements that has the classname  or we'll just call them "cards".Behold, the Modulus operator!You may think of writing different conditions or loops to achieve a solution but a more elegant one is by using the Modulus operator a.k.a the Remainder operator (). Using this operator gives you the remainder after the division of a number.Hmm, confused? Okay, here's a simple example of how a Modulus operator would be like:In plain english, if you have 10 apples and you divide them by 4 and by doing so, you'll end up with 2 sets of 4 apples and the remaining set would be 2 apples. Thus, the remainder is 2.Did that make sense? If not, then try the following code in your browser:Let's say we have 10 "cards" and we want every 3 three cards to have 3 different colors, we must just define a way to determine the index of each color while iterating through a loop of cards. So, we can easily get the index by doing so:Here's the full code:The following code will apply the colors to each "card" with respect to it's order and will reset back to the first color once it's reached it's last color based on the remainder of the next iteration in the loop.Read about Modulus Operation to know more about it.</p>

A queue should support two operations:EnqueueDequeueEnqueueAdds the element to the tail of a queue. The tail position gets incremented.DequeueRemoves the first element of a queue i.e. the head element. Once, it's removed, the subsequent element becomes the new head element of the queue. The position of the new head element gets incremented and the previous one is assigned a negative integer like -1 or some garbage value. Implementation of a standard queue using C++:In terms of memory management, a standard Queue is quite inefficient and incapable of handling dynamic memory.StacksThis follows a Last-In First-Out processing order i.e. the last element added to a queue will be the first to be removed. Just like queues, it has two simple operations:PushPopPushEach element is pushed towards the end of the stack. Think of it as a card deck where you stack a card on top of another card.PopIt removes the most recent element i.e. the newly added element from the stack.Implementation of a stack using C++:Unlike queues, stacks are easier to implement and pretty efficient at managing dynamic memory.Oh, if you ever get to use these, don't worry about implementing them, nearly all programming languages have their own implementations of  and  that comes with it's own standard library.</p>
