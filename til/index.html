						<p class="desc">I wrote a nifty command to make an archive of the files that I have modified on a particular date. By doing so, this script comes in handy during urgent deployments, so that I don't lose track of the files that I should be updating.Here's the command at your disposal:How this works?Let's see what this command does in pieces: is the utility tool used to return the filenames that match the specified parameters in the given directory. is the flag that allows you to specify the depth of recursive searches it should perform. is the flag that determines if you're looking for file or a directory. is the flag that determines if the file has been modified on and/or after the given date.Once, the file has been found, the output is being redirected to the  utility function, which would then add the files to the  file.
The  flag would perform the operation in silent mode,  flag would update the files in the archive if modified or add it as a new file if it doesn't exist and  takes the list of files from the standard input.If you want to ignore certain directories or file extensions, in that case, you can exclude them like so:Or, you can even archive the modified files by specifying a date range:Hope you found this tip useful! üòÅ</p>

						<p class="desc">Recently, we hosted our company's redesigned website on GoDaddy, which offers cPanel to manage your website. I was dealing with an annoying email bug in which I was able to send/receive emails to any account except the ones that share the company domain.The company's current email setup makes use of Google Workspace and since we're using a Shared Hosting account, GoDaddy allows you to use their SMTP relay and prohibits the use of third-party SMTP services such as Google Workspace, Outlook, etc.After configuring it with Google's MX records in the DNS settings, I wasn't receiving any email on my own company email yet I was able to receive on other email accounts that didn't share the company's domain.I did a little R&D and ran into this documentation about email routing and figured out that there could be an issue with it's configuration.Here's what I did:Open cPanel Search or look for Email RoutingClick on Email RoutingIf your MX records are not pointing to the IP address of the hosting server, then select Remote Mail ExchangerSave changesAfter following these steps, I was able to receive mails on the same domain!So what really caused the issue?Since, we didn't have a default email address set up in cPanel, the current mode to send all unrouted emails was set to , by default. I guess, it's set up that way to prevent the server from sending/receiving spam mails from the domain.This makes sense because:The MX records are not pointing to the current serverThere are no email accounts created for the domain on cPanelBy setting the mode to , all emails with the same domain are being discarded or rejectedNot really sure if this is what caused the issue but judging from the facts, I was able to reach to this conclusion.Hope you found this tip useful.ReferenceCan't send email to addresses at my own domain</p>

						<p class="desc">Open up your text editor and use the following RegEx pattern to find and remove the duplicate lines:I found this technique on Regular-Expressions.info and I'm going to quote their explanation over here:The caret will match only at the start of a line. So the regex engine will only attempt to match the remainder of the regex there. The dot and star combination simply matches an entire line, whatever its contents, if any. The parentheses store the matched line into the first backreference.Next we will match the line separator. I put the question mark into  to make this regex work with both Windows  and UNIX  text files. So up to this point we matched a line and the following line break.Now we need to check if this combination is followed by a duplicate of that same line. We do this simply with . This is the first backreference which holds the line we matched. The backreference will match that very same text.If the backreference fails to match, the regex match and the backreference are discarded, and the regex engine tries again at the start of the next line. If the backreference succeeds, the plus symbol in the regular expression will try to match additional copies of the line. Finally, the dollar symbol forces the regex engine to check if the text matched by the backreference is a complete line. We already know the text matched by the backreference is preceded by a line break (matched by ).Therefore, we now check if it is also followed by a line break or if it is at the end of the file using the dollar sign.The entire match becomes  (or  etc.). Because we are doing a search and replace, the line, its duplicates, and the line breaks in between them, are all deleted from the file. Since we want to keep the original line, but not the duplicates, we use  as the replacement text to put the original line back in.Hope you found this tip useful!</p>

In this example, we'll add some colors to a bunch of  elements that has the classname  or we'll just call them "cards".Behold, the Modulus operator!You may think of writing different conditions or loops to achieve a solution but a more elegant one is by using the Modulus operator a.k.a the Remainder operator (). Using this operator gives you the remainder after the division of a number.Hmm, confused? Okay, here's a simple example of how a Modulus operator would be like:In plain english, if you have 10 apples and you divide them by 4 and by doing so, you'll end up with 2 sets of 4 apples and the remaining set would be 2 apples. Thus, the remainder is 2.Did that make sense? If not, then try the following code in your browser:Let's say we have 10 "cards" and we want every 3 three cards to have 3 different colors, we must just define a way to determine the index of each color while iterating through a loop of cards. So, we can easily get the index by doing so:Here's the full code:The following code will apply the colors to each "card" with respect to it's order and will reset back to the first color once it's reached it's last color based on the remainder of the next iteration in the loop.Read about Modulus Operation to know more about it.</p>

						<p class="desc">As I was configuring Arch Linux setup on my old HP 8460p laptop, I noticed that I wasn't able to access any site using Chrome or Firefox as I was faced with a weird error:I was quite confused and thought it might be an issue with my WiFi card or probably some server issue but turns out it was neither of them.On the side of my screen, I noticed my system time was displaying 4 hours ahead of the current local time, which is wrong. So, I did a little research and turns out my suspicions were correct, it's a time-related issue.How is time related to secure websites?Well, each website that uses SSL or that begins with  are only valid for a period of time before getting expired. If the website that you're trying to visit presents a certificate with a time and date that doesn't match with your system's clock, Firefox will prevent you from accessing the page.How to fix it?Actually, the fix is quite simple. All you have to is just set the correct date and time on your system and you're good to go!If you're using Linux, just do the following:1. Set up your timezoneYou can look up for your timezones by executing the following:Once, you've found your timezone, execute the following by replacing  with your timezone:2. Manually set your local timeExecute the following to set up your time, locally on your system:3. Set the hardware clock from the system clockThe following command sets the hardware clock from the system clock:Now, that you've executed them, you should be able to view the correct time on your system by executing  and you should see something like this:Although, this issue was time-related, you may face the same kind of error for various other reasons.

						<p class="desc">Let's look at the differences between the two data structures:Queues: First-In First-OutStacks: Last-In Last-OutQueuesThis follows a First-In First-Out processing order i.e. the first element added to a queue will be processed first. A queue should support two operations:EnqueueDequeueEnqueueAdds the element to the tail of a queue. The tail position gets incremented.DequeueRemoves the first element of a queue i.e. the head element. Once, it's removed, the subsequent element becomes the new head element of the queue. The position of the new head element gets incremented and the previous one is assigned a negative integer like -1 or some garbage value. Implementation of a standard queue using C++:In terms of memory management, a standard Queue is quite inefficient and incapable of handling dynamic memory.StacksThis follows a Last-In First-Out processing order i.e. the last element added to a queue will be the first to be removed. Just like queues, it has two simple operations:PushPopPushEach element is pushed towards the end of the stack. Think of it as a card deck where you stack a card on top of another card.PopIt removes the most recent element i.e. the newly added element from the stack.Implementation of a stack using C++:Unlike queues, stacks are easier to implement and pretty efficient at managing dynamic memory.Oh, if you ever get to use these, don't worry about implementing them, nearly all programming languages have their own implementations of  and  that comes with it's own standard library.</p>
