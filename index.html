					<p class="desc">Tired of ensuring if whether each file in every server is synced? Planning on doing automated backups? If so, then this technique should come in handy for you.Interested? Then follow the steps below:Check if rsync over SSH worksBefore you start, please ensure that you can  to your intended server over  using a password.
With the following example, you can just send a simple file over to the intended server and see if it works or not:Once you execute this command on the terminal, it'll prompt you for a password on the remote server, if it does, then it works.Generate SSH KeysIf you want to do a passwordless SSH, you need to generate public and private SSH keys on the local server by typing the following command on the terminal:If you're prompted to enter a passphrase, just hit  and proceed until the key is generated. Once the keys are generated, they'll be in the  directory on your local server.Copy public key to remote serverUsing , you can copy the public key to the remote server:Once executed, you'll be prompted to enter the password of the account on the remote server and if successful, the public key will be copied to the remote server and will be stored in it's appropriate location.Perform Rsync over passwordless SSHIf you've come this far, then you should be able to SSH to the remote server without entering the password:If it works, then perform the  operation again (above) and this time, it shouldn't prompt you to enter any password.Hope you liked reading this short article!</p>

					<p class="desc">I like VIM and use it regularly to write and edit code on a daily basis but I always find the creation of  files really annoying.If you find them annoying too, you disable them temporarily in the editor, like this:Or if you want to disable it permanently, just add this line in your  file:Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that you should dislike  files because if the editor crashes or your computer/server crashes in midway, those files can save your progress.Hope you found this tip useful!</p>

					<p class="desc">Recently, I started reading a book called The Graphics Codex, it's an amazing book about Computer Graphics covering a lot of content and I find it quite resourceful. I wanted to build my own toy raytracer for the sake of exploring, so that's why I started to refresh my graphics coding knowledge a bit.Just like any graphics renderer, in order to view your image. you must be able to write your image to a file, right?Below, I wrote a really simple code to generate the entire RGB colored spectrum from top to bottom:You can generate it by simply creating an executable like this:Now, when you execute it by typing , you'll get a list of numbers that's pretty much a combination and permutation of RGB color values.Lastly, to generate a colored image, like the one above, just redirect the output to an image format, in this example, I used PPM image format:And that's it, you have generated your own colored image! üòÅHope you found this useful!</p>

					<p class="date">10.04.2021 <span>‚Ä¢</span> 1 minute read</p>
					<p class="desc">I wrote a nifty command to make an archive of the files that I have modified on a particular date. By doing so, this script comes in handy during urgent deployments, so that I don't lose track of the files that I should be updating.Here's the command at your disposal:How this works?Let's see what this command does in pieces: is the utility tool used to return the filenames that match the specified parameters in the given directory. is the flag that allows you to specify the depth of recursive searches it should perform. is the flag that determines if you're looking for file or a directory. is the flag that determines if the file has been modified on and/or after the given date.Once, the file has been found, the output is being redirected to the  utility function, which would then add the files to the  file.
The  flag would perform the operation in silent mode,  flag would update the files in the archive if modified or add it as a new file if it doesn't exist and  takes the list of files from the standard input.If you want to ignore certain directories or file extensions, in that case, you can exclude them like so:Or, you can even archive the modified files by specifying a date range:Hope you found this tip useful! üòÅ</p>

					<p class="desc">This error shows up when two different projects are merged (i.e. they both could be the same project but unaware of each other's existence and have different commit histories).If you are facing this, chances are that:You must have cloned a project and the  directory must have corrupted or got deleted and at this point, Git is unaware of the changes being made and will throw this error when you try to push to or pull from the remote repository.You created a new repository, made some changes and added the commits and then you tried to pull from the remote repository.Well, you can easily resolve by passing the  flag when pulling the latest updates from the remote repository:Hope you found this useful!</p>

					<p class="desc">If you're the type of person who types , please don't do that as it might overwrite your entire branch. I'm saying this because I did this once and I thought I lost all the files.Luckily, I was a bit relieved as  is a VCS (Version Control Software), which means the files are most likely not deleted. This is when I came across  command.According to the Git manual, this is what it does:Reference logs, or "reflogs", record when the tips of branches and other references were updated in the local repository.This is a life-saver especially if you wanted to return back to the previous point in time. Here's how I recovered my files back again:Type Find and make note of the previous commit hash.Create a new branch with using the previous commit hash like this: Then finally, push the files to the new branch: Checkout to the newly created branch: Delete the corrupted branch and replace it with the newly created branch that contains your restored files.If I didn't discover this, I don't really know what I would have done to recover those files.ReferencesGit reflog documentationHow can I recover from an erronous git push -f origin master?Hope this helps you out!</p>
