		<h1 class="heading"><a href="/writings/posts/my-thoughts-on-using-visual-studio-code">My thoughts on using Visual Studio Code</a></h1>
		<p class="description">My experiences on what made me like using Visual Studio Code.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="article-body">
		<p>Ever since my university days, I've always used Sublime Text for any sort of text editing and programming tasks, in general.</p>

<p>Despite the annoying "Subscription" dialog box, I like it because it's lightweight, simple and had nice keybindings that made it much more productive.</p>

<p>This week, I thought of taking Visual Studio Code for a drive, not because many developers are using it but personally, I wanted to know if it can be better than Sublime Text.</p>

<p>The answer is yes, it is and here's what I have experienced so far.</p>

<h2>Portability</h2>

<p>What I like at first is that, it's cross-platform and has support for different operating systems in various architectures. At work, I use Windows 10 and at home, I use Fedora 35 Workstation and it runs fine on both operating systems.</p>

<h2>Intellisense, Intellisense, Intellisense...</h2>

<p>Intellisense is a term used by Microsoft that includes various features like: code completion, code hinting, method parameter information and more. By default, the editor supports Intellisense for JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML and CSS. But if you install different programming language extensions like Python, PHP, Golang and so on, you'll be able to configure your editor to have a much more richer experience.</p>

<p>At work, I write PHP code and use Laravel framework to develop web applications, I installed the following extensions to make my coding experience much more productive:</p>

<ol>
<li>PHP Intelephense (bmewburn.vscode-intelephense-client)</li>
<li>phpfmt (kokororin.vscode-phpfmt)</li>
<li>Laravel Snippets (onecentlin.laravel-blade)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Sublime Text and Vim Keybindings</h2>

<p>If you've never used Vim, please go ahead and try. I believe that every programmer should try using VIM instead of fearing the keybindings (like <code>:q</code>) as they were developed for a <a href="https://betterprogramming.pub/why-you-should-learn-vim-keybindings-even-if-you-dont-use-vim-6563c5357b64?gi=92b77d015592">reason</a>.</p>

<p>But unlike Vim, Sublime Text keybindings are quite fun especially when you want to duplicate a line of code, indent lines of code, matching multiple instances of the same keyword and modifying them with multiple cursors at the same time.</p>

<p>Try installing these extensions and see if you like them:</p>

<ol>
<li>Vim Emulation for Visual Studio Code (vscodevim.vim)</li>
<li>Sublime Text Keymap and Settings Importer (ms-vscode.sublime-keybindings)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Integrated Terminal</h2>

<p>You can use different type of shells like Windows Powershell, Command Prompt, Git Bash and much more. Besides IMO, I found that using the integrated terminal was quite productive as I didn't have to switch windows in between.</p>

<h2>Looks minimal</h2>

<p>When it comes to UI/UX, the word <strong>minimalism</strong> is often subjective but I guess Microsoft embraced the principles of minimalism for this editor.</p>

<h2>Lots of extensions and great support</h2>

<p>Thanks to the open source community, there are hundreds and thousands of extensions out there. By installing various extensions, you can make it your own editor and that part fascinates me.</p>

<p>Besides, it's developed by Microsoft, so it definitely has a strong support and community out there.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I guess the simplicity and flexibility of this editor is what made it more powerful amongst the developer community.</p>

<p>Now, I'm not going to say that it's a flawless editor, just like every other pieces of software, it does have it's cons. However, I decided to try out Visual Studio Code for a while and see how it goes for me.</p>

<p>If it doesn't then maybe I might write a post about why I didn't like using it, in the future.</p>

<p>Hope you liked reading this article.</p>

		<h1 class="heading"><a href="/til/posts/using-iife-in-javascript">Using IIFE in JavaScript</a></h1>
		<p class="description"></p>
	</div>
	<div class="article-body">
		<p>IIFE a.k.a Immediately-Invoked Function Expression &mdash; is a way to execute functions as soon as the function is created.</p>

<p>Using IIFE, you can easily isolate declared variables away from the global scope.</p>

<p>This is how the syntax would look like:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1">// ES5 Standard</span>
<span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">foo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(){</span>
    <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">message</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Hello world&quot;</span>
    <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">message</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">})();</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>They can be defined with arrow functions as well:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1">// ES6 Standard</span>
<span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">foo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(()</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">message</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Hello world&quot;</span>
    <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">message</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">})();</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>According to <strong>MDN Docs</strong>, it's a design pattern a.k.a Self-Executing Anonymous Function. There are two parts to this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The function that's enclosed within the Grouping Operator <code>()</code>, which would prevent it from polluting the global space and access to the variables within it's scope.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>();</code> will create the Immediately Invoked Function Expression on-the-fly.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>When to use it?</h2>

<p>There are many interesting cases such as if you are following the <a href="https://www.patterns.dev/posts/classic-design-patterns/">Module Pattern</a> especially if you want to avoid polluting the global namespace or just that you don't want your code to interfere with other code thus ensures code safety.</p>

		<p class="description">Thought of giving a colorful touch to the site.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="article-body">
		<p>Ten days ago, I launched a new makeover for the blog and I felt that it needed a little bit of a colorful yet unique touch.</p>

<p>Recently, I started playing around with the concept of Generative Art and have been studying a lot of about various patterns like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bauhaus</li>
<li>Truchet Tiles</li>
<li>Piet Mondrian</li>
</ul>

<p>So, I thought of writing a new pattern generator using CSS and JavaScript that would assign each article a unique, colorful pattern. Though, it's not yet quite complete, I would consider it to be an experimental feature to see if it goes well with the site.</p>

<p>What do you think about it? Does it look good? What kind of patterns should I add to my generator?</p>

<p>Interested on how it's implemented? Have a look at the <a href="/static/js/art.js">source code</a>.</p>

<p>Hope you found this article to be inspiring!</p>

		<p class="description"></p>
	</div>
	<div class="article-body">
		<p>I wanted to download a webpage along with it's assets and scripts, I tried using Chrome's <strong>Save as...</strong> option but it wasn't working as expected.</p>

<p>I did a little googling and thought of using <code>wget</code> to do the job and it worked. Here's the command I used:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>wget -p -k -H --nd https://www.example.com
</code></pre></div>

<p>Let's see what do those flags mean:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>-p</code>: Downloads all the necessary files to properly display the downloaded HTML page.</li>
<li><code>-k</code>: After the download is complete, it converts the links in the document to make them suitable for local viewing.</li>
<li><code>-H</code>: This would download files that spans different hosts.</li>
<li><code>--nd</code>: While retrieving files recursively, it will not create a hierarchy of directories and downloads the files into a single directory instead.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you open <code>index.html</code> directly on the browser, the assets might be broken as the <code>-k</code> flag doesn't seem to make the assets relative to the root directory. In order to view it, you can view it on a localhost server like WAMP, XAMPP or if you are using Python, you can type <code>python -m http.server</code> and view your downloaded file.</p>

<p>Might be a bit messy but gets the job done.</p>
