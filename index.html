					<p class="date">12.03.2021 <span>â€¢</span> 2 minutes read</p>
					<p class="desc">Recently, we hosted our company's redesigned website on GoDaddy, which offers cPanel to manage your website. I was dealing with an annoying email bug in which I was able to send/receive emails to any account except the ones that share the company domain.The company's current email setup makes use of Google Workspace and since we're using a Shared Hosting account, GoDaddy allows you to use their SMTP relay and prohibits the use of third-party SMTP services such as Google Workspace, Outlook, etc.After configuring it with Google's MX records in the DNS settings, I wasn't receiving any email on my own company email yet I was able to receive on other email accounts that didn't share the company's domain.I did a little R&D and ran into this documentation about email routing and figured out that there could be an issue with it's configuration.Here's what I did:Open cPanel Search or look for Email RoutingClick on Email RoutingIf your MX records are not pointing to the IP address of the hosting server, then select Remote Mail ExchangerSave changesAfter following these steps, I was able to receive mails on the same domain!So what really caused the issue?Since, we didn't have a default email address set up in cPanel, the current mode to send all unrouted emails was set to , by default. I guess, it's set up that way to prevent the server from sending/receiving spam mails from the domain.This makes sense because:The MX records are not pointing to the current serverThere are no email accounts created for the domain on cPanelBy setting the mode to , all emails with the same domain are being discarded or rejectedNot really sure if this is what caused the issue but judging from the facts, I was able to reach to this conclusion.Hope you found this tip useful.ReferenceCan't send email to addresses at my own domain</p>

					<p class="desc">If you're facing this error while trying to download a file from your server, it's most probably the SSL certificate that has been hosted on your server isn't correctly verified or maybe, you're using OpenSSL on a server running PHP 5.6.As per the documentation, there are some changes that can be made to resolve it, like the following method:Although, I won't recommend this unless you are testing it on a  environment as it's not secure and could have significant security implications because disabling verification can permit a Man in the Middle attack to take place.Use it at your own risk!</p>

					<p class="desc">Today, I was debugging a piece of code that is supposed to return a list of data based on the year, the funny thing is that the data was being returned on the development server but not on the production one.Weird, so I opened up MySQL Workbench and wrote a simple query to see if the dates were being returned because who knows maybe they weren't stored at all.The values returned were . Now, that's strange because the dates were present in the column. So, I took a deep look and figured out that the dates were stored in  instead of  data type! ðŸ˜”Luckily, I figured that there's a way to resolve this by  function:Bam! The results were coming now! ðŸ˜ŒHope this helps you out!</p>
