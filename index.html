					<p class="desc">Simply put, sometimes, there are situations in where you just want to clear the contents of a file without deleting it.This could be for many reasons like to avoid permission related issues, or maybe the file could be having useless logs that amasses to a size that measures in GBs.So, the easiest solution is to clear it away from a terminal is by shell redirection like so:Let me break down the command here:The  symbol means  and doesn't produce any output.The '>' symbol is used for redirecting the output of the preceding command (in this case, it's empty!) is the file that you want to truncate. If it doesn't exist, the file will be created.Alternatively, you can do the same by using the  command to output the contents of the  device (which only contains a EOL character) to empty a file:Hope this comes in handy!</p>
