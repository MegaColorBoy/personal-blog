According to this forum, a recent MariaDB update introduced a new bug for PHP versions < 7.3 that uses PDO and MySQL connectors. You can easily resolve this by simply upgrading it to PHP 7.3.Hope this tip helps you out!</p>

					<p class="desc">There are many ways to define constants in Laravel but I learnt a neat technique where you can define constants using an alias.First off, create the following directory:Next, create a file named  in the  directory and copy-paste the following code:Then, go to the  file and define your new alias:Lastly, execute the following commands to update your app's configuration:After that, you can use your new constants anywhere (Controllers, Models or Blades) like this:Learning this new technique helps me keep the code clean and makes it easier to trace the constants.Hope you find this tip useful!</p>

					<p class="date">07.11.2020 <span>•</span> 2 minutes read</p>
					<p class="desc">Open up your text editor and use the following RegEx pattern to find and remove the duplicate lines:I found this technique on Regular-Expressions.info and I'm going to quote their explanation over here:The caret will match only at the start of a line. So the regex engine will only attempt to match the remainder of the regex there. The dot and star combination simply matches an entire line, whatever its contents, if any. The parentheses store the matched line into the first backreference.Next we will match the line separator. I put the question mark into  to make this regex work with both Windows  and UNIX  text files. So up to this point we matched a line and the following line break.Now we need to check if this combination is followed by a duplicate of that same line. We do this simply with . This is the first backreference which holds the line we matched. The backreference will match that very same text.If the backreference fails to match, the regex match and the backreference are discarded, and the regex engine tries again at the start of the next line. If the backreference succeeds, the plus symbol in the regular expression will try to match additional copies of the line. Finally, the dollar symbol forces the regex engine to check if the text matched by the backreference is a complete line. We already know the text matched by the backreference is preceded by a line break (matched by ).Therefore, we now check if it is also followed by a line break or if it is at the end of the file using the dollar sign.The entire match becomes  (or  etc.). Because we are doing a search and replace, the line, its duplicates, and the line breaks in between them, are all deleted from the file. Since we want to keep the original line, but not the duplicates, we use  as the replacement text to put the original line back in.Hope you found this tip useful!</p>

					<p class="desc">Using branches are one of the most powerful features of Git and becomes a part of the software development process.Last night, I came across an issue where I created a new branch and committed my changes until the  tool rejected it because the branch was already created by someone else in the repository.Luckily, I was able to resolve this issue by renaming my branch using  command.Here's a short guide on how you can do that too!1. Switch to the remote branch you want to rename2. Rename the current remote branchProceed to the next step, if you've pushed your old branch to the remote repository.3. Push the renamed remote branch4. Delete the old remote branchIf you've come this far without any issues, you've successfully renamed your local and remote Git branch.Hope you found this useful!</p>

					<p class="desc">Yesterday, I decided to try XFCE desktop environment and boy, it's really faster than the GNOME desktop environment.As soon as I started to play around with it, I noticed a good amount of screen tearing and to my surprise, I came to know that the XFCE environment is known to have such issues.After a few minutes of research, I was able to fix it. Here are the steps:Note: This is done on Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic BeaverIf you dont have the package  installed in your system, do it right now:After you're done installing, type the following command to find out which graphics you're using:If you're using an Intel Graphics Driver, you'll probably get something like this:You can try go to Settings Manager->Window Manager Tweaks->Compositor" and enable **Synchronize drawing to the vertical blank. From what I've read, if you do that, it should stop but it didn't do anything for me.If the above technique didn't work, go to  and create a file for your graphics card named .Copy-paste the following configuration into the file:Save the file, reboot your system and look for any screen tearing issues. If you didn't face any, that means it worked! 😁</p>
