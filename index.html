					<p class="date">27.02.2022 <span>•</span> 3 minutes read</p>
					<p class="desc">Thought of writing a small tutorial on how to install NGINX and PHP on Windows. You can also use this as a reference if you wanted to install them on Windows Server too. NoteThis tutorial won't teach you how to configure both PHP and NGINX configurations as there are a lot of tutorials focusing on that topic.Setting up NGINXDownload NGINX for WindowsGo to  directory and create a folder named .Unzip the downloaded  file in  directory.Go to  and create two new folders named  and .To test, if it's working, double-click on  and type  in the browser. You should be able to see a Welcome page.Kill the NGINX process from Task Manager.Setting up PHPDownload PHP 8.1 for Windows.Go to  directory and create a folder named  or if you wanted to have multiple versions, .Unzip the downloaded  file in  directory.Add PHP to your system environment variables by adding the path Open Command Prompt and type . You see should be able to see the version if it's installed correctly.Run NGINX and PHP as separate servicesGenerally, it's good practice to run both PHP and NGINX as background services or else, you might have to start the processes manually every time the server goes down.As I was looking for a way to do that, I stumbled upon this post on StackOverflow and it was quite helpful.Install NSSM Service ManagerNSSM Service Manager is a free open-source alternative that helps you create a service with the help of GUI. Below are the steps that I followed:Download NSSM Service ManagerGo to  directory and create a folder named .Unzip the downloaded  file in  directory.Install NGINX as a serviceOpen Command Prompt as an Administrator.Go to  directory.Type Define the path of the  file.Click on .Press  and type .Look for  and start the service.Open your browser and type  to see if it's working correctly.Install PHP as a serviceOpen Command Prompt as an Administrator.Go to  directory.Type Define the path of the  file.Add the arguments: Click on .Press  and type .Look for  and start the service.Useful commands while using NSSMTest to see if it works!Before you proceed with the following steps, ensure that you include the  files from the  folder in your  file.Add the following line to your  file:Go to  directory and create .Go to  and create directory.Refer to the sample configuration provided and make the necessary changes.To enable the site, you have to create a symlink: .Ensure the configuration doesn't have any errors by typing  in  directory.Restart the NSSM service.Add an entry in your hosts file: .And you're done! TipIf you get a "Connection Refused" or error that is similar to that, it's most probably due to firewall or maybe the PHP service isn't running.Sample NGINX Virtual Host ConfigurationConclusionIf you've gotten this far, give yourself a pat in the back.Hope you've found this tutorial useful and please share it with your friends and colleagues if they really need it!</p>

					<p class="desc">I tried to find a proper guide on how to install MySQL 8.0 on Void Linux but I couldn't really find any. So, I thought of installing MariaDB 10.3 on my laptop instead.Don't worry about using MariaDB as it meets the same standard enterprised requirements as MySQL. The only difference is that MySQL belongs to Oracle and MariaDB is for people who wanted to get out of Oracle's hands.Anyway, let's get started.PrerequisitesNeed to have root privileges in order to install packages.Basic know-how of Void Linux and it's  package manager.Alright, go ahead and follow these steps one-by-one:1.

Initialize MySQL data directoryThe following command will initialize a MariaDB data directory and create system tables in the MySQL database, if they are not present.The options used:: The login user name to use for running the  process. The path to the MariaDB installation directory.: The path to the MariaDB directory.To know more about it, you can refer to MariaDB's documentation.3. Enable MySQL serviceIf you are used to Ubuntu or CentOS, enabling services in Void Linux is a bit different but quite simple. Once a process is symlinked, it will start on boot and restarts if it stops unless you stop the service deliberately.Type the following command to enable the  service:4. Start MySQL serviceType the following command to start the  service:To confirm, if the service is running, type the following:And you'll see something like this: 5. Secure MySQL installationIt's recommended to secure your installation, so type the following command:Once the command is executed, you'll be prompted with a few questions, respond according to your needs and you're done!6. Test MariaDB connectionNow, all you have to do is, try to log in to your database by typing the following:Once executed, it would prompt you for your password (which you must have set in the previous step and if you are able to log in, you are good to go!Hope this guide helps you out!</p>

					<p class="date">02.10.2021 <span>•</span> 1 minute read</p>
					<p class="desc">Simply put, sometimes, there are situations in where you just want to clear the contents of a file without deleting it.This could be for many reasons like to avoid permission related issues, or maybe the file could be having useless logs that amasses to a size that measures in GBs.So, the easiest solution is to clear it away from a terminal is by shell redirection like so:Let me break down the command here:The  symbol means  and doesn't produce any output.The '>' symbol is used for redirecting the output of the preceding command (in this case, it's empty!) is the file that you want to truncate. If it doesn't exist, the file will be created.Alternatively, you can do the same by using the  command to output the contents of the  device (which only contains a EOL character) to empty a file:Hope this comes in handy!</p>
