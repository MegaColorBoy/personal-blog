		<p>Hello there! My name is Abdush Shakoor and I like problem solving and building stuff for fun!</p>

<p>I'm a full stack software engineer living in Dubai, United Arab Emirates with a passion for Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Digital Design and Technology.</p>

<!-- During the past years, I've done internships with various companies including Oracle Corporation, Dubai. Find out more about my career on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdush-shakoor-mohamed-nazeer-b5546546) profile. -->

<!-- As of **October 2019**, I'm looking for **better opportunities** to expand my programming and skills, so if you're a recruiter/well-wisher and interested in me, send me an [email](mailto:abdushshakoor1992@hotmail.com) about it.

My last job was at [Key Information Technology](https://www.kit.ae) in which I was building the company's website and productive tools for teams. Find out more about my career on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdush-shakoor-mohamed-nazeer-b5546546) profile. -->

<p>Currently, I work at <a href="https://www.pgsuae.com">Planet Green Solutions</a> as a Backend Engineer who develops web applications for various clients that mostly comprises of Government Entities of the United Arab Emirates.</p>

<p>Oh, I'm also part of the Backend team that helped build <a href="https://www.farmsgate.com">FarmsGate</a>, an eCommerce platform for farmers that can sell and deliver fresh fruits and vegetables to your doorstep!</p>

<p><a href="/static/resume.pdf">Check out my resume to learn more about my work experience &rarr;</a></p>

<p>In my spare time, I love to tinker with my computer science and software engineering projects like implementing new algorithms, learning new programming languages or paradigms, building a game and so on. I also design conceptual user interfaces after being exposed to the <a href="https://dailyui.co">DailyUI</a> project.</p>

<!-- [Click here to see my UI/UX portfolio &rarr;](#) -->

<p>In fact, this blog is built from scratch. No bootstrap, no heavy UI frameworks or libraries are used as I found it quite unnecessary for a minimalist blog.</p>

<div class="post-notification">
    <h3>Blog engine updated!</h3>
    <p>As of March 1st 2019, I have changed my blog engine from a dynamic website to a custom-built static site generator. <a href="../posts/say-hello-new-blog/">Read more &rarr;</a></p>

<p>I'm an intermediate-level toss juggler and I love to spend time practicing my juggling skills. Apart from that, I practice calisthenics, read books and listen to instrumental music.</p>
