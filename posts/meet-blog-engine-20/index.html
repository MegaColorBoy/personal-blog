    <h3>Blog engine updated!</h3>
    <p>As of March 1st 2019, I have changed my blog engine from a dynamic website to a custom-built static site generator. <a href="#">Read more &rarr;</a></p>
</div>

<p>Whenever I'm writing a new blog post, I would write it using HTML on my
text editor i.e. using <strong><em>Sublime Text</em></strong>Â and copy-paste the source code
into my blog engine and hit "Submit" and that was really annoying.</p>

<p>You might be thinking to yourself as to why I'm putting myself through
such a tedious process to write a blog article when there are several
<strong><em>WYSIWYG</em></strong> text editor plugins.</p>

<p>Truth is, I have to admit that I was lazy and I cared a lot about
writing my blog articles but never cared about the tool I had built that
to write my blog articles, so I decided to upgrade it and make it even
better than what it was previously!</p>

<h2>Why rewrite it?</h2>

<p>For starters, the old one had a clunky and pretty much boring user
interface. I used <strong><em>CKEditor</em></strong> text editor plugin but to be honest, I
rarely used any of it's features as I was just directly copy-pasting my
source code from Sublime Text to the text field box.</p>

<p>Over time, it became slow due to spaghetti code and it required a lot of
code refactoring as I wrote this code during my earlier days of
programming by following various programming tutorials.</p>

<p>Here's some screenshots of the old blog engine:</p>

    <figcaption>
    Fig.3: Edit page
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And, last but not the least, it didn't make me feel like I was writing a
blog but rather felt like writing HTML code in a more tedious manner.</p>

<h2>Time for a change!</h2>

<p>For the past two weeks, I have been working on a new version of the blog
engine and I had decided to give it some new features like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clean and paper-like user interface by taking inspiration from Google's Material Theming Design guidelines</li>
<li>Minimal text editor built from scratch that can be extensible in the future</li>
<li>Auto-save article every minute</li>
<li>Emojis, LaTeX syntax, JavaScript files and IFRAME windows</li>
<li>Live search bar to filter articles by keywords or categories</li>
</ul>

<p>In case, you're wondering, I built this using vanilla JavaScript and a
custom-built MVC PHP framework with a MySQL database.</p>

<p>Here's some screenshots of the new blog engine:</p>

    <img src="/static/images/be-v2-2.png" />

        Fig.5: Minimal Text Editor
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>What I really wanted to achieve with the new blog engine is that I want
to give myself an enjoyable writing experience besides, this blog post
was written from the new blog engine.</p>

<p>Well, it's stable as of yet but I need to run a few tests and build more
functionalities before deploying it on my production server and finally
saying good-bye to the old version.</p>

<p>Hope you liked reading this article!</p>
