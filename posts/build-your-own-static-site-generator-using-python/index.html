				<p>If you are curious about web development, you must have came across names like Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby and more. These names that I mentioned are called Static Site generators. In fact, this website that you're on, is powered by a static site generator and I really like it so far.</p>

<p>In today's article, you'll learn how to build your own Static Site Generator using Python, create a blog and host it on Netlify for free.</p>

<p>This tutorial doesn't require any pre-requisites but it's recommended that you understand Python and have a know-how on using the command-line.</p>

<p>Before we jump in, let's see why is it the latest craze!</p>

<h2>Why is it popular?</h2>

<p>Take a blog, it's a dynamic web application that consists of a lot of sections like blog posts, archives and categories. Each time, a user visits a blog post, it sends a GET request to the server, fetches the data, then generates a webpage along with the fetched data on-the-fly. However, with a static site generator, you only serve pre-rendered files, so you don't have to generate or create anything on-the-fly, it's already there!</p>

<p>Apart from that, applications like a blog are usually database-dependant and you need to host it somewhere with a price. Not only that, but it does have security risks. With static site generators, you write your content on a markdown file and then convert it into static HTML files, which can then be used to host your website on services like GitHub Pages or Netlify for free and you don't have to worry about any security issues.</p>

<h2>Time to build it!</h2>

<p>Let's plan before we dive in straight into coding it. This is the file structure we'll be following in this tutorial:</p>

<h3>Functionalities</h3>

<p>We're going to be building a simple blog engine, so these are the functionalities that we need in a blog:</p>

<ul>
<li>Home page</li>
<li>About page</li>
<li>Categories</li>
<li>Pagination</li>
</ul>

<h3>Create file structure</h3>

<p>This is the file structure we're going to follow in this tutorial.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
    > ssg-py/
        > content/
            > articles/
            > about/
        > templates/
            > includes/
        > output/
            > pages/
            > about/ 
            > posts/ 
            > static/ 
        > ssg.py
        > make_entry.py
        > build_blog.sh
    </code>
</pre>

<p>If you're lazy to create it on your own, just copy-paste these commands into your command-line and execute:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
    mkdir ssg-py && mkdir ssg-py/content && mkdir ssg-py/content/articles && mkdir ssg-py/content/about && mkdir ssg-py/templates && mkdir output && touch ssg.py && touch make_entry.py && touch build_blog.sh
    </code>
</pre>

<p>Okay, that looks good. Install the following dependencies using <mark>pip</mark>:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
    pip install markdown2
    pip install jinja2
    </code>
</pre>

<h3>Generate markdown files</h3>

<p>Go to your <mark>make_entry.py</mark> file and copy-paste this code. This will be used to generate markdown file for you to edit instead of having to create it manually all the time.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
    import os, sys
    from glob import glob
    from datetime import datetime

    TEMPLATE = """
    title: {title}
    date: {date}
    slug: {slug}
    category: Write category here.
    summary: Write summary here.

    Write content here.
    """

    def suffix(d):
        return 'th' if 11<=d<=13 else {'1':'st', '2':'nd', '3':'rd'}.get(d%10, 'th')

    def custom_strftime(format, t):
        return t.strftime(format).replace('{S}', str(t.day) + suffix(t.day))

    # Generate file number by looking at the number blog articles in the directory
    def gen_file_no(file_path, existing_files):
        """
            If no files are found,
            then this is the first file.
        """
        if not existing_files:
            return 1

        """
            Look for the biggest file number
            and return the bigger one
        """
        prefixes = [filename.replace(file_path,"")[:2] for filename in existing_files]
        biggest_prefix = max(prefixes, key= lambda n: int(n))
        return int(biggest_prefix) + 1

    # Generate slug for the blog article
    def gen_slug(title):
        title = "".join(x for x in title if x.isalnum() or x == ' ')
        title = title.lower().strip("").replace(' ','-')
        return title

    # Create entry
    def make_entry(title, file_type):
        if file_type == "articles" or "projects":

            file_path = "content/" + file_type + "/"

            # Create folders if they didn't exist
            if not os.path.exists(file_path):
                os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(file_path))

            today = datetime.today()

            slug = gen_slug(title)
            file_no = gen_file_no(file_path, existing_files=glob(file_path + "*.md"))
            blog_file_path = file_path + "{:0>2}_{}_{:0>2}_{:0>2}_{}.md".format(file_no, today.year, today.month, today.day, slug)

            post_date = datetime.strptime(str(today.date()), '%Y-%m-%d')
            post_date = custom_strftime('%B {S}, %Y', post_date)

            t = TEMPLATE.strip().format(title=title,
                year=today.year,
                month=today.month,
                date=post_date,
                slug=slug)      

            with open(blog_file_path, 'w') as w:
                w.write(t)

            print blog_file_path

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        if len(sys.argv) > 1:
            make_entry(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2])
        else:
        print "Enter blog title and article type"
    </code>
</pre>

<p>To create a blog entry, just type this in your terminal:</p>

<pre>
    <code>
    python make_entry.py "Article Name" articles
    </code>
</pre>

<h3>Create a module/library</h3>

<p>In this library, you'll have all of the necessary functions to generate your blog such as read/write files, pagination, categories and templating.</p>

<pre>
    <code>
    touch ssg.py
    </code>
</pre>

<p>At the beginning of this article, I mentioned that markdown files are converted into static files. So, let's create a function that fetches the markdown files from the <mark>content</mark> directory.</p>

<pre>
    <code class="python">
    def get_markdown_files(section):
        --- insert code here ---
    </code>
</pre>

<h3>Deploy project on Netlify</h3>

<p>If you've reached here, then that means you're able to generate your blog without any issues in your system. Great, let's see how to deploy it on Netlify.</p>

<h4>1. Create a GitHub repository</h4>

<p>If you have a GitHub account, continue reading. If not, <a href="https://github.com">go here</a>.</p>

<p>Create a repository with any name you like and push all your files into the repository.</p>

<h4>2. Connect to Netlify</h4>

<p>Create an account on Netlify.com and then connect to your GitHub account. After that, you have to select the repository that has your static files (Not the python code).</p>

<h4>3. Sit and Relax</h4>

<p>At this stage, your blog will be deployed automatically and you'll be given a unique URL to view your website.</p>

<p>If you have a custom domain, I suggest you follow the instructions and make the necessary changes in the <mark>CNAME</mark> and <mark>A</mark> records.</p>

<p>Don't worry about the SSL certificate, it does take some time to activate, it took me like 7-8 hours to get it working.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you've completed this tutorial, give a yourself a pat in the back because now you know how static site generators work and you've built and hosted your own blog on the internet.</p>

<p>Hope you liked reading this article and please share it to others too!</p>

<p>P.S: I just realized that this is my 50th blog post! :D</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more!</p>
