				<p>Recently, I have started learning Laravel and now, I'm building an application for my new company using this amazing framework.</p>

<p>My senior developer was curious and thought of having a conversation with me that went like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Senior dev: Hmm, can I have a look at your code?</p>
  
  <p>Me: Oh sure, here take a look.</p>
  
  <p>Senior: (Goes through project file structure)</p>
  
  <p>Senior: So, have you ever thought of using events in your application?</p>
  
  <p>Me: Yeah, I wrote a custom JavaScript file to handle and fire events on the client-side like validating the forms and passing async requests to the server.</p>
  
  <p>Senior: Hmm, that's okay but I'm talking events using Laravel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point, I was pretty clueless and I didn't know what the heck was going on. Events in PHP? I mean, I know about it in JavaScript because of it's event-driven architecture that we are all familiar with. But in PHP? I didn't know that.</p>

<p>Still confused, he proceeds to explain about it's concepts in an abstract manner and thanks to him, it induced my curiosity by asking myself: <strong><em>What's the deal in between using events over function calls using a route on a standard controller?</em></strong></p>

<p>In today's article, I'll be talking about why and when to use events over function calls using Laravel in your application.</p>

<h2>What's an event?</h2>

<p>An event is a piece of reusable logic stored somewhere in your application that has a set of listeners waiting to be executed, if triggered.</p>

<p>Let's say, you have a simple CRUD application that involves user registration. Whenever a user registers, you may want to perform certain actions, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adding them into your mailing list</li>
<li>Confirmation of account</li>
</ul>

<p>You can add more but this is just to give you an idea. Let's see take a look at two different approaches:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="#approach-1">Functional</a></li>
<li><a href="#approach-2">Events and Listeners</a></li>
</ol>

<h3><a id="approach-1"></a> Functional</h3>

<p>If you're using an MVC framework (Laravel, in our case), you'd do this in a controller with a bunch of methods like so:</p>

<pre>
    <code class="php">
    &lt;?php
    namespace App\Http\Controllers;

    use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
    use App\User;

    class UserController extends Controller {
        public function index() {
            // insert code to view users page
        }

        public function create(Request $request) {
            $arr = [
                'username' => $request->username,
                'email' => $request->email,
                'password' => bcrypt('something')
            ];

            $user = User::create($arr);

            $this->sendConfirmationEmail($user);
            $this->subscribeToMailingList($user);
        }

        // Send confirmation email to user
        private function sendConfirmationEmail($user) {
            // insert code
        }

        // Subscribe user to mailing list
        private function subscribeToMailingList($user) {
            // insert code
        }
    }
    ?&gt;
    </code>
</pre>

<p>This is approach is self-contained and simple to follow but you're also adding in a lot of responsibility to your controller.</p>

<p>Not only that, what if the user wants to register from another place in your application, in that case, you'll have to duplicate your logic in multiple places.</p>

<h3><a id="approach-2"></a> Events and Listeners</h3>

<p>Using this approach, you can split this into <mark>Event</mark> and <mark>Listener</mark> files in your application.</p>

<pre>
    <code class="php">
    &lt;?php
    namespace App\Http\Controllers;

    use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
    use App\User;

    class UserController extends Controller {
        public function index() {
            // insert code to view users page
        }

        public function create(Request $request) {
            $arr = [
                'username' => $request->username,
                'email' => $request->email,
                'password' => bcrypt('something')
            ];

            $user = User::create($arr);

            // Emit event
            event(new UserRegistered($user));
        }
    }
    ?&gt;
    </code>
</pre>

<p>This is how your <mark>UserRegistered</mark> event would look like:</p>

<pre>
    <code class="php">
    &lt;?php
    namespace App\Events;

    use Illuminate\Queue\SerializeModels;
    use App\User;

    class UserRegistered {
        use SerializesModels;

        public $user;

        public function __construct(User $user) {
            $this->user = $user;
        }
    }
    ?&gt;
    </code>
</pre>

<p>And this is how your <mark>SendConfirmationEmail</mark> listener would look like:</p>

<pre>
    <code class="php">
    &lt;?php
    namespace App\Listeners;

    use App\Events\UserRegistered;

    class SendConfirmationEmail {

        public function __construct(User $user) {
            // insert code
        }

        public function handle(UserRegister $event) {
            // insert code
        }
    }
    ?&gt;
    </code>
</pre>

<p>Using this approach, you can use the <mark>UserRegistered</mark> event anywhere you wanted in your application. No matter what happens, it will trigger the same actions as it was intended to do so. If you want to add a new functionality, create a new listener and register it with the event in your <mark>EventServiceProvider</mark> file like this:</p>

<pre>
    <code class="php">
    protected $listen = [
        'App\Events\UserRegistered' => [
        'App\Listeners\SendConfirmationEmail',
        ],
    ];
    </code>
</pre>

<p>If you follow this approach, your logic complexity is toned down and the controller will have less responsibility.</p>

<h2>Why use events and listeners over function calls?</h2>

<p>Just like this answer that I found on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4503723/why-use-event-listeners-over-function-calls">StackOverflow</a> question regarding events and listeners over calling functions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You might not be in control of the code that's doing the calling. Or even if you are, you don't want to introduce dependencies into that code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Think about it, what if you built an API or library that you want people to use but don't want them to modify the source code. Instead, you could provide a documentation that states specific events are raised under specific circumstances, in turn, they can write code that responds to such events.</p>

<p>I'm sure that there are more examples as to where this methodology might be applied.</p>

<h2>When to use it?</h2>

<p>Truth be told, it depends. If you have a simple application, then a functional approach is all you need but it's a larger and more complicated application, using Events and Listeners can be a better option.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Please note, I'm not an expert at this topic as I'm still learning and I thought of sharing what I had learnt. If you have any suggestions or thoughts, please share it with me on <a href="https://twitter.com/megacolorboy">Twitter</a> or <a href="mailto:megacolorboy@gmail.com">send me</a> a message to my inbox.</p>

<p>Hope you liked reading this article.</p>
